Subject: Disabled hginstallscripts @LIBDIR@ replacement in setup.py.

Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/620087
Bug-Ubuntu: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/745250
Forwarded: not-needed

setup.py replaces @LIBDIR@ in the hg script, with a path that differs between
Python versions.
libdir in hg doesn't need to be set if mercurial is available in the public
namespace, as it is in Debian.
hg doesn't alter sys.paths if this replacement hasn't happened.
