mercurial (0.9.1+20061210+8c24b6fd5866-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    snapshot before 0.9.2 release
  * [debian/control] : update maintainer field : I'am DD now :-)

 -- Vincent Danjean <vdanjean@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Dec 2006 22:40:30 +0100

mercurial (0.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    Major changes between Mercurial 0.9 and 0.9.1:

     New features:
     - You can now configure your 'hgweb' server to let remote users
       'push' changes over http.
     - You can now 'import' a patch in a mail message by saving the mail
       message, and importing it.  This works for patches sent either
       inline or as attachments.
     - The 'diff' command now accepts '-rA:B' syntax as a synonym for
       '-r A -r B', and adds '-b' and '-B' options.

     New contributions and extensions:
     - The 'acl' extension lets you lock down parts of a repository
       against incoming changes
     - The 'extdiff' extension lets you run your favourite graphical
       change viewer
     - Comprehensive integration with the 'vim' editor
     - A restricted shell for 'ssh'-hosted repositories
     - An importer for 'darcs' repositories

     New hooks added:
     - 'preupdate' is run before an update or merge in the working
       directory.
     - 'update' is run after an update or merge in the working
       directory.

     Behaviour changes:
     - NOTE: Mercurial as installed by the Windows binary
       installer no longer performs automatic line-ending conversion for
       Unix/Linux compatibility.  To re-enable this feature, edit your
       'mercurial.ini' file after you upgrade.
     - The Windows binary installer now automatically adds 'hg' to your
       '%PATH%'.
     - The 'backout' command now runs an editor by default, to let you
       modify the commit message for a backed-out changeset.
     - An earlier problem with parsing of tags has been fixed.
       This makes tag parsing slower but more reliable.

     Memory usage and performance improvements:
     - The 'remove' command has been rewritten to be hundreds of times
       faster in large repositories.
     - It is now possible to 'clone' a repository very quickly over a
       LAN, if the server is configured to allow it.  See the new 'server'
       section in the 'hgrc' documentation.

     Other changes of note:
     - Mercurial will now print help for an extension if you type 'hg
       help EXT_NAME'.
     - The usual array of bug fixes and documentation improvements.
     - The integrated web server is now more WSGI-compliant.
     - Work has begun to solidify Mercurial's API for use by third-party
       packages.

mercurial (0.9-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Force the use of python2.4 with a sed command. A race condition on some
    autobuilders makes that workaround needed. (Really closes: #378835)

 -- Vincent Danjean <Vincent.Danjean@ens-lyon.org>  Thu, 20 Jul 2006 17:59:35 +0200

mercurial (0.9-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * do not use default python but python2.4 instead for hg :
    most code is python2.3 compatible (so we still compile .py files for
    pyhton2.3) but "hg help" need features for python2.4
    Closes: #378835
    Thanks David Douard for reporting this.
  * adding missing manpage hgignore (Closes: #378502)
    Thanks Baruch Even for reporting this.
  * remove hack in postinst (dpkg not replacing directory by symlink) as it is
    no more useful (directory was in /usr/lib/python2.3, symlink in now in
    /usr/lib/python2.4)
  * Create symlinks for the templates directory within the mercurial directory
    (and not in another python serch path) (Closes: #378538)

 -- Vincent Danjean <Vincent.Danjean@ens-lyon.org>  Wed, 19 Jul 2006 12:25:30 +0200

  * fix a bug in update/revert (patch from Vadim Gelfer already applied
    upstream)
  * [debian/control] build-depend on python as dh_python require it
    (package did not fail to build due to an indirect build-dependency
    but it is safer like that)

 -- Vincent Danjean <Vincent.Danjean@ens-lyon.org>  Fri, 12 May 2006 19:30:44 +0200

mercurial (0.9-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    Major changes between Mercurial 0.8.1 and 0.9:
     - The repository file format has been improved.
       - This has resulted in an average 40% reduction in disk space usage.
       - The new format (called RevlogNG) is now the default.
       - Mercurial works perfectly with both the old and new repository
         file formats. It can transfer changes transparently between
         repositories of either format.
       - To use the new repository format, simply use `hg clone --pull` to
         clone an existing repository.
       - Note: Versions 0.8.1 and earlier of Mercurial cannot read
         RevlogNG repositories directly, but they can `clone`, `pull`
         from, and `push` to servers that are serving RevlogNG
         repositories.
     - Memory usage has been improved by over 50% for many common operations.
     - Substantial performance improvements on large repositories.
     - New commands:
       - 'archive' - generate a directory tree snapshot, tarball, or zip
         file of a revision
     - Deprecated commands:
       - 'addremove' - replaced by 'add' and 'remove --after'
       - 'forget' - replaced by 'revert'
       - 'undo' - replaced by 'rollback'
     - New extensions:
       - Bugzilla integration hook
       - Email notification hook
     - Nested repositories are now supported. Mercurial will not recurse
       into a subdirectory that contains a '.hg' directory. It is treated
       as a separate repository.
     - The standalone web server, 'hg serve', is now threaded, so it can
       talk to multiple clients at a time.
     - The web server can now display a "message of the day".
     - Support added for hooks written in Python.
     - Many improvements and clarifications to built-in help.
  * [debian/control] set Standard-Version to 3.7.2 (no changes required)

mercurial (0.8.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * use python2.4 instead of standard python (2.3 for now):
    this allows to use hglib backend with tailor
  * several minor fixes so that tailor works with the 'hglib' backend
    these are submitted upstream
  * hardcode python interpreter in script instead of using /usr/bin/env
    as suggested by the python policy
  * remove previous hack (dpkg not replacing directory by symlink) as
    it is no more useful (directory was in /usr/lib/python2.3, symlink in now
    in /usr/lib/python2.4)
