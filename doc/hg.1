.SH COMMANDS
.SS Repository creation
.SS clone
.sp
make a copy of an existing repository:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg clone [OPTION]... SOURCE [DEST]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Create a copy of an existing repository in a new directory.
.sp
If no destination directory name is specified, it defaults to the
basename of the source.
.sp
The location of the source is added to the new repository\(aqs
\fB.hg/hgrc\fP file, as the default to be used for future pulls.
.sp
Only local paths and \fBssh://\fP URLs are supported as
destinations. For \fBssh://\fP destinations, no working directory or
\fB.hg/hgrc\fP will be created on the remote side.
.sp
If the source repository has a bookmark called \(aq@\(aq set, that
revision will be checked out in the new repository by default.
.sp
To check out a particular version, use \-u/\-\-update, or
\-U/\-\-noupdate to create a clone with no working directory.
.sp
To pull only a subset of changesets, specify one or more revisions
identifiers with \-r/\-\-rev or branches with \-b/\-\-branch. The
resulting clone will contain only the specified changesets and
their ancestors. These options (or \(aqclone src#rev dest\(aq) imply
\-\-pull, even for local source repositories.
.sp
In normal clone mode, the remote normalizes repository data into a common
exchange format and the receiving end translates this data into its local
storage format. \-\-stream activates a different clone mode that essentially
copies repository files from the remote with minimal data processing. This
significantly reduces the CPU cost of a clone both remotely and locally.
However, it often increases the transferred data size by 30\-40%. This can
result in substantially faster clones where I/O throughput is plentiful,
especially for larger repositories. A side\-effect of \-\-stream clones is
that storage settings and requirements on the remote are applied locally:
a modern client may inherit legacy or inefficient storage used by the
remote or a legacy Mercurial client may not be able to clone from a
modern Mercurial remote.
.IP Note
.
Specifying a tag will include the tagged changeset but not the
changeset containing the tag.
.RE
.sp
For efficiency, hardlinks are used for cloning whenever the
source and destination are on the same filesystem (note this
applies only to the repository data, not to the working
directory). Some filesystems, such as AFS, implement hardlinking
incorrectly, but do not report errors. In these cases, use the
\-\-pull option to avoid hardlinking.
.sp
Mercurial will update the working directory to the first applicable
revision from this list:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP a. 3
.
null if \-U or the source repository has no changesets
.IP b. 3
.
if \-u . and the source repository is local, the first parent of
the source repository\(aqs working directory
.IP c. 3
.
the changeset specified with \-u (if a branch name, this means the
latest head of that branch)
.IP d. 3
.
the changeset specified with \-r
.IP e. 3
.
the tipmost head specified with \-b
.IP f. 3
.
the tipmost head specified with the url#branch source syntax
.IP g. 3
.
the revision marked with the \(aq@\(aq bookmark, if present
.IP h. 3
.
the tipmost head of the default branch
.IP i. 3
.
tip
.UNINDENT
.sp
When cloning from servers that support it, Mercurial may fetch
pre\-generated data from a server\-advertised URL or inline from the
same stream. When this is done, hooks operating on incoming changesets
and changegroups may fire more than once, once for each pre\-generated
bundle and as well as for any additional remaining data. In addition,
if an error occurs, the repository may be rolled back to a partial
clone. This behavior may change in future releases.
See \%\fBhg help \-e clonebundles\fP\: for more.

Show definition of symbolic path name NAME. If no name is given,
show definition of all available names.
.sp
Option \-q/\-\-quiet suppresses all output when searching for NAME
and shows only the path names when listing all definitions.
.sp
Path names are defined in the [paths] section of your
configuration file and in \fB/etc/mercurial/hgrc\fP. If run inside a
repository, \fB.hg/hgrc\fP is used, too.
.sp
The path names \fBdefault\fP and \fBdefault\-push\fP have a special
meaning.  When performing a push or pull operation, they are used
as fallbacks if no location is specified on the command\-line.
When \fBdefault\-push\fP is set, it will be used for push and
\fBdefault\fP will be used for pull; otherwise \fBdefault\fP is used
as the fallback for both.  When cloning a repository, the clone
source is written as \fBdefault\fP in \fB.hg/hgrc\fP.
.IP Note
.
\fBdefault\fP and \fBdefault\-push\fP apply to all inbound (e.g.
\%\fBhg incoming\fP\:) and outbound (e.g. \%\fBhg outgoing\fP\:, \%\fBhg email\fP\:

hg pull [\-u] [\-f] [\-r REV]... [\-e CMD] [\-\-remotecmd CMD] [SOURCE]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Pull changes from a remote repository to a local one.
.sp
This finds all changes from the repository at the specified path
or URL and adds them to a local repository (the current one unless
\-R is specified). By default, this does not update the copy of the
project in the working directory.
.sp
When cloning from servers that support it, Mercurial may fetch
pre\-generated data. When this is done, hooks operating on incoming
changesets and changegroups may fire more than once, once for each
pre\-generated bundle and as well as for any additional remaining
data. See \%\fBhg help \-e clonebundles\fP\: for more.
.sp
Use \%\fBhg incoming\fP\: if you want to see what would have been added
by a pull at the time you issued this command. If you then decide
to add those changes to the repository, you should use \%\fBhg pull
\-r X\fP\: where \fBX\fP is the last changeset listed by \%\fBhg incoming\fP\:.
.sp
If SOURCE is omitted, the \(aqdefault\(aq path will be used.
See \%\fBhg help urls\fP\: for more information.
.sp
If multiple sources are specified, they will be pulled sequentially as if
the command was run multiple time. If \-\-update is specify and the command
will stop at the first failed \-\-update.
.sp
Specifying bookmark as \fB.\fP is equivalent to specifying the active
bookmark\(aqs name.
.sp
One can use the \fI\-\-remote\-hidden\fP flag to pull changesets
hidden on the remote. This flag is "best effort", and will only
work if the server supports the feature and is configured to
allow the user to access hidden changesets. This option is
experimental and backwards compatibility is not garanteed.

push changes to the specified destination:

hg push [\-f] [\-r REV]... [\-e CMD] [\-\-remotecmd CMD] [DEST]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Push changesets from the local repository to the specified
destination.
.sp
This operation is symmetrical to pull: it is identical to a pull
in the destination repository from the current one.
.sp
By default, push will not allow creation of new heads at the
destination, since multiple heads would make it unclear which head
to use. In this situation, it is recommended to pull and merge
before pushing.
.sp
Use \-\-new\-branch if you want to allow push to create a new named
branch that is not present at the destination. This allows you to
only create a new branch without forcing other changes.
.IP Note
.
Extra care should be taken with the \-f/\-\-force option,
which will push all new heads on all branches, an action which will
almost always cause confusion for collaborators.
.RE
.sp
If \-r/\-\-rev is used, the specified revision and all its ancestors
will be pushed to the remote repository.
.sp
If \-B/\-\-bookmark is used, the specified bookmarked revision, its
ancestors, and the bookmark will be pushed to the remote
repository. Specifying \fB.\fP is equivalent to specifying the active
bookmark\(aqs name. Use the \-\-all\-bookmarks option for pushing all
current bookmarks.
.sp
Please see \%\fBhg help urls\fP\: for important details about \fBssh://\fP
URLs. If DESTINATION is omitted, a default path will be used.
.sp
When passed multiple destinations, push will process them one after the
other, but stop should an error occur.
.sp
The \-\-pushvars option sends strings to the server that become
environment variables prepended with \fBHG_USERVAR_\fP. For example,
\fB\-\-pushvars ENABLE_FEATURE=true\fP, provides the server side hooks with
\fBHG_USERVAR_ENABLE_FEATURE=true\fP as part of their environment.
.sp
pushvars can provide for user\-overridable hooks as well as set debug
levels. One example is having a hook that blocks commits containing
conflict markers, but enables the user to override the hook if the file
is using conflict markers for testing purposes or the file format has
strings that look like conflict markers.
.sp
By default, servers will ignore \fI\-\-pushvars\fP. To enable it add the
following to your configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[push]
pushvars.server = true
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Returns 0 if push was successful, 1 if nothing to push.

Start a local HTTP repository browser and pull server. You can use
this for ad\-hoc sharing and browsing of repositories. It is
recommended to use a real web server to serve a repository for
longer periods of time.
.sp
Please note that the server does not implement access control.
This means that, by default, anybody can read from the server and
nobody can write to it by default. Set the \fBweb.allow\-push\fP
option to \fB*\fP to allow everybody to push to the server. You
should use a real web server if you need to authenticate users.

By default, the server logs accesses to stdout and errors to
stderr. Use the \-A/\-\-accesslog and \-E/\-\-errorlog options to log to

Commit changes to the given files into the repository. Unlike a
centralized SCM, this operation is a local operation. See
\%\fBhg push\fP\: for a way to actively distribute your changes.
.sp
If a list of files is omitted, all changes reported by \%\fBhg status\fP\:

.sp
If no commit message is specified, Mercurial starts your
configured editor where you can enter a message. In case your
commit fails, you will find a backup of your message in
\fB.hg/last\-message.txt\fP.
.sp
The \-\-close\-branch flag can be used to mark the current branch
head closed. When all heads of a branch are closed, the branch
will be considered closed and no longer listed.
.sp
The \-\-amend flag can be used to amend the parent of the
working directory with a new commit that contains the changes
in the parent in addition to those currently reported by \%\fBhg status\fP\:,
if there are any. The old commit is stored in a backup bundle in
\fB.hg/strip\-backup\fP (see \%\fBhg help bundle\fP\: and \%\fBhg help unbundle\fP\:
on how to restore it).
.sp
Message, user and date are taken from the amended commit unless
specified. When a message isn\(aqt specified on the command line,
the editor will open with the message of the amended commit.

.SS graft
.sp
copy changes from other branches onto the current branch:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg graft [OPTION]... [\-r REV]... REV...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This command uses Mercurial\(aqs merge logic to copy individual
changes from other branches without merging branches in the
history graph. This is sometimes known as \(aqbackporting\(aq or
\(aqcherry\-picking\(aq. By default, graft will copy user, date, and
description from the source changesets.
.sp
Changesets that are ancestors of the current revision, that have
already been grafted, or that are merges will be skipped.
.sp
If \-\-log is specified, log messages will have a comment appended
of the form:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
(grafted from CHANGESETHASH)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If \-\-force is specified, revisions will be grafted even if they
are already ancestors of, or have been grafted to, the destination.
This is useful when the revisions have since been backed out.
.sp
If a graft merge results in conflicts, the graft process is
interrupted so that the current merge can be manually resolved.
Once all conflicts are addressed, the graft process can be
continued with the \-c/\-\-continue option.
.sp
The \-c/\-\-continue option reapplies all the earlier options.
.sp
The \-\-base option exposes more of how graft internally uses merge with a
custom base revision. \-\-base can be used to specify another ancestor than
the first and only parent.
.sp
The command:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg graft \-r 345 \-\-base 234
.ft P
.fi
.sp
is thus pretty much the same as:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg diff \-\-from 234 \-\-to 345 | hg import
.ft P
.fi
.sp
but using merge to resolve conflicts and track moved files.
.sp
The result of a merge can thus be backported as a single commit by
specifying one of the merge parents as base, and thus effectively
grafting the changes from the other side.
.sp
It is also possible to collapse multiple changesets and clean up history
by specifying another ancestor as base, much like rebase \-\-collapse
\-\-keep.
.sp
The commit message can be tweaked after the fact using commit \-\-amend .
.sp
For using non\-ancestors as the base to backout changes, see the backout
command and the hidden \-\-parent option.

Bookmarks are labels on changesets to help track lines of development.
Bookmarks are unversioned and can be moved, renamed and deleted.
Deleting or moving a bookmark has no effect on the associated changesets.

Creating or updating to a bookmark causes it to be marked as \(aqactive\(aq.
The active bookmark is indicated with a \(aq*\(aq.

.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg tag [\-f] [\-l] [\-m TEXT] [\-d DATE] [\-u USER] [\-r REV] NAME...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Name a particular revision using <name>.
.sp
Tags are used to name particular revisions of the repository and are
very useful to compare different revisions, to go back to significant
earlier versions or to mark branch points as releases, etc. Changing
an existing tag is normally disallowed; use \-f/\-\-force to override.
.sp
If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is
used.
.sp
To facilitate version control, distribution, and merging of tags,
they are stored as a file named ".hgtags" which is managed similarly
to other project files and can be hand\-edited if necessary. This
also means that tagging creates a new commit. The file
".hg/localtags" is used for local tags (not shared among
repositories).
.sp
Tag commits are usually made at the head of a branch. If the parent
of the working directory is not a branch head, \%\fBhg tag\fP\: aborts; use
\-f/\-\-force to force the tag commit to be based on a non\-head
changeset.
.sp
See \%\fBhg help dates\fP\: for a list of formats valid for \-d/\-\-date.
.sp
Since tag names have priority over branch names during revision
lookup, using an existing branch name as a tag name is discouraged.

.sp
If you include \-\-file, \-\-user, or \-\-date, the revision number is
suppressed unless you also include \-\-number.
.sp

.sp
Show differences between revisions for the specified files.
.sp
Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.
.IP Note
.
\%\fBhg diff\fP\: may generate unexpected results for merges, as it will
default to comparing against the working directory\(aqs first
parent changeset if no revisions are specified.  To diff against the
conflict regions, you can use \fI\-\-config diff.merge=yes\fP.
.RE
.sp
By default, the working directory files are compared to its first parent. To
see the differences from another revision, use \-\-from. To see the difference
to another revision, use \-\-to. For example, \%\fBhg diff \-\-from .^\fP\: will show
the differences from the working copy\(aqs grandparent to the working copy,
\%\fBhg diff \-\-to .\fP\: will show the diff from the working copy to its parent
(i.e. the reverse of the default), and \%\fBhg diff \-\-from 1.0 \-\-to 1.2\fP\: will
show the diff between those two revisions.
.sp
Alternatively you can specify \-c/\-\-change with a revision to see the changes
in that changeset relative to its first parent (i.e. \%\fBhg diff \-c 42\fP\: is
equivalent to \%\fBhg diff \-\-from 42^ \-\-to 42\fP\:)
.sp
Without the \-a/\-\-text option, diff will avoid generating diffs of
files it detects as binary. With \-a, diff will generate a diff
anyway, probably with undesirable results.
.sp
Use the \-g/\-\-git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff
format. For more information, read \%\fBhg help diffs\fP\:.

subdivision search of changesets:
.sp
.nf

hg bisect [\-gbsr] [\-U] [\-c CMD] [REV]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This command helps to find changesets which introduce problems. To
use, mark the earliest changeset you know exhibits the problem as
bad, then mark the latest changeset which is free from the problem
as good. Bisect will update your working directory to a revision
for testing (unless the \-U/\-\-noupdate option is specified). Once
you have performed tests, mark the working directory as good or
bad, and bisect will either update to another candidate changeset
or announce that it has found the bad revision.
.sp
As a shortcut, you can also use the revision argument to mark a
revision as good or bad without checking it out first.
.sp
If you supply a command, it will be used for automatic bisection.
The environment variable HG_NODE will contain the ID of the
changeset being tested. The exit status of the command will be
used to mark revisions as good or bad: status 0 means good, 125
means to skip the revision, 127 (command not found) will abort the
bisection, and any other non\-zero exit status means the revision
is bad.

.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg identify [\-nibtB] [\-r REV] [SOURCE]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Print a summary identifying the repository state at REV using one or
two parent hash identifiers, followed by a "+" if the working
directory has uncommitted changes, the branch name (if not default),
a list of tags, and a list of bookmarks.
.sp
When REV is not given, print a summary of the current state of the
repository including the working directory. Specify \-r. to get information
of the working directory parent without scanning uncommitted changes.
.sp
Specifying a path to a repository root or Mercurial bundle will
cause lookup to operate on that repository/bundle.

show revision history of entire repository or files:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg log [OPTION]... [FILE]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Print the revision history of the specified files or the entire
project.
.sp
If no revision range is specified, the default is \fBtip:0\fP unless
\-\-follow is set.
.sp
File history is shown without following rename or copy history of
files. Use \-f/\-\-follow with a filename to follow history across
renames and copies. \-\-follow without a filename will only show
ancestors of the starting revisions. The starting revisions can be
specified by \-r/\-\-rev, which default to the working directory parent.
.sp
By default this command prints revision number and changeset id,
tags, non\-trivial parents, user, date and time, and a summary for
each commit. When the \-v/\-\-verbose switch is used, the list of
changed files and full commit message are shown.
.sp
With \-\-graph the revisions are shown as an ASCII art DAG with the most
recent changeset at the top.
\(aqo\(aq is a changeset, \(aq@\(aq is a working directory parent, \(aq%\(aq is a changeset
involved in an unresolved merge conflict, \(aq_\(aq closes a branch,
\(aqx\(aq is obsolete, \(aq*\(aq is unstable, and \(aq+\(aq represents a fork where the
changeset from the lines below is a parent of the \(aqo\(aq merge on the same
line.
Paths in the DAG are represented with \(aq|\(aq, \(aq/\(aq and so forth. \(aq:\(aq in place
of a \(aq|\(aq indicates one or more revisions in a path are omitted.
.sp
Use \-L/\-\-line\-range FILE,M:N options to follow the history of lines
from M to N in FILE. With \-p/\-\-patch only diff hunks affecting
specified line range will be shown. This option requires \-\-follow;
it can be specified multiple times. Currently, this option is not
compatible with \-\-graph. This option is experimental.
.IP Note
.
\%\fBhg log \-\-patch\fP\: may generate unexpected diff output for merge
changesets, as it will only compare the merge changeset against
its first parent. Also, only files different from BOTH parents
will appear in files:.
.RE
.IP Note
.
For performance reasons, \%\fBhg log FILE\fP\: may omit duplicate changes
made on branches and will not show removals or mode changes. To
see all such changes, use the \-\-removed switch.
.RE
.IP Note
.
The history resulting from \-L/\-\-line\-range options depends on diff
options; for instance if white\-spaces are ignored, respective changes
with only white\-spaces in specified line range will not be listed.

Use the \-s/\-\-similarity option to detect renamed files. This
option takes a percentage between 0 (disabled) and 100 (files must
be identical) as its parameter. With a parameter greater than 0,
this compares every removed file with every added file and records
those similar enough as renames. Detecting renamed files this way
can be expensive. After using this option, \%\fBhg status \-C\fP\: can be
used to check which files were identified as moved or renamed. If
not specified, \-s/\-\-similarity defaults to 100 and only renames of
identical files are detected.

.sp
Merges with unresolved conflicts are often the result of
non\-interactive merging using the \fBinternal:merge\fP configuration
setting, or a command\-line merge tool like \fBdiff3\fP. The resolve
command is used to manage the files involved in a merge, after
\%\fBhg merge\fP\: has been run, and before \%\fBhg commit\fP\: is run (i.e. the
working directory must have two parents). See \%\fBhg help
merge\-tools\fP\: for information on configuring merge tools.

The resolve command can be used in the following ways:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

\%\fBhg resolve [\-\-re\-merge] [\-\-tool TOOL] FILE...\fP\:: attempt to re\-merge
the specified files, discarding any previous merge attempts. Re\-merging
is not performed for files already marked as resolved. Use \fB\-\-all/\-a\fP
to select all unresolved files. \fB\-\-tool\fP can be used to specify
the merge tool used for the given files. It overrides the HGMERGE
environment variable and your configuration files.  Previous file
contents are saved with a \fB.orig\fP suffix.
.IP \(bu 2
.
\%\fBhg resolve \-m [FILE]\fP\:: mark a file as having been resolved
(e.g. after having manually fixed\-up the files). The default is
to mark all unresolved files.
.IP \(bu 2
.
\%\fBhg resolve \-u [FILE]...\fP\:: mark a file as unresolved. The
default is to mark all resolved files.
.IP \(bu 2
.
\%\fBhg resolve \-l\fP\:: list files which had or still have conflicts.
In the printed list, \fBU\fP = unresolved and \fBR\fP = resolved.
You can use \fBset:unresolved()\fP or \fBset:resolved()\fP to filter
the list. See \%\fBhg help filesets\fP\: for details.

.RE
.sp
With no revision specified, revert the specified files or directories
to the contents they had in the parent of the working directory.
This restores the contents of files to an unmodified
state and unschedules adds, removes, copies, and renames. If the
working directory has two parents, you must explicitly specify a
revision.
.sp
Using the \-r/\-\-rev or \-d/\-\-date options, revert the given files or
directories to their states as of a specific revision. Because
revert does not change the working directory parents, this will
cause these files to appear modified. This can be helpful to "back
out" some or all of an earlier change. See \%\fBhg backout\fP\: for a
related method.
.sp
Modified files are saved with a .orig suffix before reverting.
To disable these backups, use \-\-no\-backup. It is possible to store
the backup files in a custom directory relative to the root of the

.nf

hg shelve [OPTION]... [FILE]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Shelving takes files that "hg status" reports as not clean, saves
the modifications to a bundle (a shelved change), and reverts the
files so that their state in the working directory becomes clean.
.sp
To restore these changes to the working directory, using "hg
unshelve"; this will work even if you switch to a different
commit.
.sp
When no files are specified, "hg shelve" saves all not\-clean
files. If specific files or directories are named, only changes to
those files are shelved.
.sp
In bare shelve (when no files are specified, without interactive,
include and exclude option), shelving remembers information if the
working directory was on newly created branch, in other words working
directory was on different branch than its first parent. In this
situation unshelving restores branch information to the working directory.
.sp
Each shelved change has a name that makes it easier to find later.
The name of a shelved change defaults to being based on the active
bookmark, or if there is no active bookmark, the current named
branch.  To specify a different name, use \fB\-\-name\fP.
.sp
To see a list of existing shelved changes, use the \fB\-\-list\fP
option. For each shelved change, this will print its name, age,

\%\fBhg status\fP\: may appear to disagree with diff if permissions have
changed or a merge has occurred. The standard diff format does
not report permission changes and diff only reports changes
relative to one merge parent.
.RE
.sp
If one revision is given, it is used as the base revision.
If two revisions are given, the differences between them are
shown. The \-\-change option can also be used as a shortcut to list
the changed files of a revision from its first parent.
.sp
The codes used to show the status of files are:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
M = modified
A = added
R = removed
C = clean
! = missing (deleted by non\-hg command, but still tracked)
? = not tracked
I = ignored
  = origin of the previous file (with \-\-copies)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The \-t/\-\-terse option abbreviates the output by showing only the directory
name if all the files in it share the same status. The option takes an
argument indicating the statuses to abbreviate: \(aqm\(aq for \(aqmodified\(aq, \(aqa\(aq
for \(aqadded\(aq, \(aqr\(aq for \(aqremoved\(aq, \(aqd\(aq for \(aqdeleted\(aq, \(aqu\(aq for \(aqunknown\(aq, \(aqi\(aq
for \(aqignored\(aq and \(aqc\(aq for clean.
.sp
It abbreviates only those statuses which are passed. Note that clean and
ignored files are not displayed with \(aq\-\-terse ic\(aq unless the \-c/\-\-clean
and \-i/\-\-ignored options are also used.
.sp
The \-v/\-\-verbose option shows information when the repository is in an
unfinished merge, shelve, rebase state etc. You can have this behavior
turned on by default by enabling the \fBcommands.status.verbose\fP option.
.sp
You can skip displaying some of these states by setting
\fBcommands.status.skipstates\fP to one or more of: \(aqbisect\(aq, \(aqgraft\(aq,
\(aqhistedit\(aq, \(aqmerge\(aq, \(aqrebase\(aq, or \(aqunshelve\(aq.

.ft P
.fi
.sp
This command accepts an optional name of a shelved change to
restore. If none is given, the most recent shelved change is used.
.sp
If a shelved change is applied successfully, the bundle that
contains the shelved changes is moved to a backup location
(.hg/shelve\-backup).
.sp
Since you can restore a shelved change on top of an arbitrary
commit, it is possible that unshelving will result in a conflict
between your changes and the commits you are unshelving onto. If
this occurs, you must resolve the conflict, then use
\fB\-\-continue\fP to complete the unshelve operation. (The bundle
will not be moved until you successfully complete the unshelve.)
.sp
(Alternatively, you can use \fB\-\-abort\fP to abandon an unshelve
that causes a conflict. This reverts the unshelved changes, and
leaves the bundle in place.)
.sp
If bare shelved change (without interactive, include and exclude
option) was done on newly created branch it would restore branch
information to the working directory.
.sp
After a successful unshelve, the shelved changes are stored in a
backup directory. Only the N most recent backups are kept. N
defaults to 10 but can be overridden using the \fBshelve.maxbackups\fP
configuration option.
.sp
Timestamp in seconds is used to decide order of backups. More
than \fBmaxbackups\fP backups are kept, if same timestamp
prevents from deciding exact order of them, for safety.
.sp
Selected changes can be unshelved with \fB\-\-interactive\fP flag.
The working directory is updated with the selected changes, and
only the unselected changes remain shelved.
Note: The whole shelve is applied to working directory first before
running interactively. So, this will bring up all the conflicts between
working directory and the shelve, irrespective of which changes will be
unshelved.

.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg bundle [\-f] [\-t BUNDLESPEC] [\-a] [\-r REV]... [\-\-base REV]... FILE [DEST]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Generate a bundle file containing data to be transferred to another
repository.
.sp
To create a bundle containing all changesets, use \-a/\-\-all
(or \-\-base null). Otherwise, hg assumes the destination will have
all the nodes you specify with \-\-base parameters. Otherwise, hg
will assume the repository has all the nodes in destination, or
default\-push/default if no destination is specified, where destination
is the repositories you provide through DEST option.
.sp
You can change bundle format with the \-t/\-\-type option. See
\%\fBhg help bundlespec\fP\: for documentation on this format. By default,
the most appropriate format is used and compression defaults to
bzip2.
.sp
The bundle file can then be transferred using conventional means
and applied to another repository with the unbundle or pull
command. This is useful when direct push and pull are not
available or when exporting an entire repository is undesirable.
.sp
Applying bundles preserves all changeset contents including
permissions, copy/rename information, and revision history.

.sp
Print the changeset header and diffs for one or more revisions.
If no revision is given, the parent of the working directory is used.
.sp
The information shown in the changeset header is: author, date,
branch name (if non\-default), changeset hash, parent(s) and commit
comment.
.IP Note

Without the \-a/\-\-text option, export will avoid generating diffs
of files it detects as binary. With \-a, export will generate a

.SS import
.sp
import an ordered set of patches:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg import [OPTION]... PATCH...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Import a list of patches and commit them individually (unless
\-\-no\-commit is specified).
.sp
To read a patch from standard input (stdin), use "\-" as the patch
name. If a URL is specified, the patch will be downloaded from
there.
.sp
Import first applies changes to the working directory (unless
\-\-bypass is specified), import will abort if there are outstanding
changes.
.sp
Use \-\-bypass to apply and commit patches directly to the
repository, without affecting the working directory. Without
\-\-exact, patches will be applied on top of the working directory
parent revision.
.sp
You can import a patch straight from a mail message. Even patches
as attachments work (to use the body part, it must have type
text/plain or text/x\-patch). From and Subject headers of email
message are used as default committer and commit message. All
text/plain body parts before first diff are added to the commit
message.
.sp
If the imported patch was generated by \%\fBhg export\fP\:, user and
description from patch override values from message headers and
body. Values given on command line with \-m/\-\-message and \-u/\-\-user
override these.
.sp
If \-\-exact is specified, import will set the working directory to
the parent of each patch before applying it, and will abort if the
resulting changeset has a different ID than the one recorded in
the patch. This will guard against various ways that portable
patch formats and mail systems might fail to transfer Mercurial
data or metadata. See \%\fBhg bundle\fP\: for lossless transmission.
.sp
Use \-\-partial to ensure a changeset will be created from the patch
even if some hunks fail to apply. Hunks that fail to apply will be
written to a <target\-file>.rej file. Conflicts can then be resolved
by hand before \%\fBhg commit \-\-amend\fP\: is run to update the created
changeset. This flag exists to let people import patches that
partially apply without losing the associated metadata (author,
date, description, ...).
.IP Note
.
When no hunks apply cleanly, \%\fBhg import \-\-partial\fP\: will create
an empty changeset, importing only the patch metadata.
.RE
.sp
With \-s/\-\-similarity, hg will attempt to discover renames and
copies in the patch in the same way as \%\fBhg addremove\fP\:.
.sp
It is possible to use external patch programs to perform the patch
by setting the \fBui.patch\fP configuration option. For the default
internal tool, the fuzz can also be configured via \fBpatch.fuzz\fP.
See \%\fBhg help config\fP\: for more information about configuration
files and how to use these options.

Please use \%\fBhg commit \-\-amend\fP\: instead of rollback to correct
mistakes in the last commit.
.sp
This command should be used with care. There is only one level of
rollback, and there is no way to undo a rollback. It will also
restore the dirstate at the time of the last transaction, losing
any dirstate changes since that time. This command does not alter
the working directory.
.sp
Transactions are used to encapsulate the effects of all commands
that create new changesets or propagate existing changesets into a
repository.
.sp
For example, the following commands are transactional, and their
effects can be rolled back:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
commit
.IP \(bu 2
.
import
.IP \(bu 2
.
pull
.IP \(bu 2
.
push (with this repository as the destination)
.IP \(bu 2
.
unbundle
.UNINDENT
.sp
To avoid permanent data loss, rollback will refuse to rollback a
commit transaction if it isn\(aqt checked out. Use \-\-force to
override this protection.
.sp
The rollback command can be entirely disabled by setting the
\fBui.rollback\fP configuration setting to false. If you\(aqre here
because you want to use rollback and it\(aqs disabled, you can
re\-enable the command by setting \fBui.rollback\fP to true.
.sp
This command is not intended for use on public repositories. Once
changes are visible for pull by other users, rolling a transaction
back locally is ineffective (someone else may already have pulled
the changes). Furthermore, a race is possible with readers of the
repository; for example an in\-progress pull from the repository
may fail if a rollback is performed.

Returns 0 on success, 1 if no rollback data is available.

.SS Uncategorized commands
.SS admin::chainsaw\-update
.sp
pull and update to a given revision, no matter what, (EXPERIMENTAL):
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg admin::chainsaw\-update [OPTION] \-\-rev REV \-\-source SOURCE \-\-dest DEST
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Context of application: \fIsome\fP Continuous Integration (CI) systems,
packaging or deployment tools.
.sp
Wanted end result: local repository at the given REPO_PATH, having the
latest changes to the given revision and with a clean working directory
updated at the given revision.
.sp
chainsaw\-update pulls from one source, then updates the working directory
to the given revision, overcoming anything that would stand in the way.
.sp
By default, it will:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
clone if the local repo does not exist yet, \fBremoving any directory
at the given path\fP that would not be a Mercurial repository.
The initial clone is full by default, so that clonebundles can be
applied. Use the \-\-initial\-clone\-minimal flag to avoid this.
.IP \(bu 2
.
break locks if needed, leading to possible corruption if there
is a concurrent write access.
.IP \(bu 2
.
perform recovery actions if needed
.IP \(bu 2
.
revert any local modification.
.IP \(bu 2
.
purge unknown and ignored files.
.IP \(bu 2
.
go as far as to reclone if everything else failed (not implemented yet).
.UNINDENT
.sp
DO NOT use it for anything else than performing a series
of unattended updates, with full exclusive repository access each time
and without any other local work than running build scripts.
In case the local repository is a share (see \%\fBhg help share\fP\:), exclusive
write access to the share source is also mandatory.
.sp
It is recommended to run these commands with the \fBHGPLAIN\fP environment
variable (see \%\fBhg scripting\fP\:).
.sp
Motivation: in Continuous Integration and Delivery systems (CI/CD), the
occasional remnant or bogus lock are common sources of waste of time (both
working time and calendar time). CI/CD scripts tend to grow with counter\-
measures, often done in urgency. Also, whilst it is neat to keep
repositories from one job to the next (especially with large
repositories), an exceptional recloning is better than missing a release
deadline.
.sp
Options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-purge\-unknown
.
Remove unversioned files before update. Disabling this can in some cases interfere with the update.See also \%\fBhg purge\fP\:. (default: True)
.TP
.B \-\-purge\-ignored
.
Remove ignored files before update. Disable this for instance to reuse previous compiler object files. See also \%\fBhg purge\fP\:. (default: True)
.TP
.BI \-\-rev \ <VALUE>
.
revision to update to
.TP
.BI \-\-source \ <VALUE>
.
repository to clone from
.TP
.BI \-\-dest \ <VALUE>
.
repository to update to REV (possibly cloning)
.TP
.B \-\-initial\-clone\-minimal
.
Pull only the prescribed revision upon initial cloning. This has the side effect of ignoring clone\-bundles, which if often slower on the client side and stressful to the server than applying available clone bundles.
.UNINDENT
.SH BUNDLE FILE FORMATS
.sp
Mercurial supports generating standalone "bundle" files that hold repository
data. These "bundles" are typically saved locally and used later or exchanged
between different repositories, possibly on different machines. Example
commands using bundles are \%\fBhg bundle\fP\: and \%\fBhg unbundle\fP\:.
.sp
Generation of bundle files is controlled by a "bundle specification"
("bundlespec") string. This string tells the bundle generation process how
to create the bundle.
.sp
A "bundlespec" string is composed of the following elements:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B type
.
A string denoting the bundle format to use.
.TP
.B compression
.
Denotes the compression engine to use compressing the raw bundle data.
.TP
.B parameters
.
Arbitrary key\-value parameters to further control bundle generation.
.UNINDENT
.sp
A "bundlespec" string has the following formats:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B <type>
.
The literal bundle format string is used.
.TP
.B <compression>\-<type>
.
The compression engine and format are delimited by a hyphen (\fB\-\fP).
.UNINDENT
.sp
Optional parameters follow the \fB<type>\fP. Parameters are URI escaped
\fBkey=value\fP pairs. Each pair is delimited by a semicolon (\fB;\fP). The
first parameter begins after a \fB;\fP immediately following the \fB<type>\fP
value.
.SS Available Types
.sp
The following bundle <type> strings are available:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B v1
.
Produces a legacy "changegroup" version 1 bundle.
.sp
This format is compatible with nearly all Mercurial clients because it is
the oldest. However, it has some limitations, which is why it is no longer
the default for new repositories.
.sp
\fBv1\fP bundles can be used with modern repositories using the "generaldelta"
storage format. However, it may take longer to produce the bundle and the
resulting bundle may be significantly larger than a \fBv2\fP bundle.
.sp
\fBv1\fP bundles can only use the \fBgzip\fP, \fBbzip2\fP, and \fBnone\fP compression
formats.
.TP
.B v2
.
Produces a version 2 bundle.
.sp
Version 2 bundles are an extensible format that can store additional
repository data (such as bookmarks and phases information) and they can
store data more efficiently, resulting in smaller bundles.
.sp
Version 2 bundles can also use modern compression engines, such as
\fBzstd\fP, making them faster to compress and often smaller.
.UNINDENT
.SS Available Compression Engines
.sp
The following bundle <compression> engines can be used:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBbzip2\fP
.sp
An algorithm that produces smaller bundles than \fBgzip\fP.
.sp
All Mercurial clients should support this format.
.sp
This engine will likely produce smaller bundles than \fBgzip\fP but
will be significantly slower, both during compression and
decompression.
.sp
If available, the \fBzstd\fP engine can yield similar or better
compression at much higher speeds.
.TP
.B \fBgzip\fP
.sp
zlib compression using the DEFLATE algorithm.
.sp
All Mercurial clients should support this format. The compression
algorithm strikes a reasonable balance between compression ratio
and size.
.TP
.B \fBnone\fP
.sp
No compression is performed.
.sp
Use this compression engine to explicitly disable compression.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The compression engines can be prepended with \fBstream\fP to create a streaming bundle.
These are bundles that are extremely efficient to produce and consume,
but do not have guaranteed compatibility with older clients.
.SS Available Options
.sp
The following options exist:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B changegroup
.
Include the changegroup data in the bundle (default to True).
.TP
.B cg.version
.
Select the version of the changegroup to use. Available options are : 01, 02
or 03. By default it will be automatically selected according to the current
repository format.
.TP
.B obsolescence
.
Include obsolescence\-markers relevant to the bundled changesets.
.TP
.B phases
.
Include phase information relevant to the bundled changesets.
.TP
.B revbranchcache
.
Include the "tags\-fnodes" cache inside the bundle.
.TP
.B tagsfnodescache
.
Include the "tags\-fnodes" cache inside the bundle.
.UNINDENT
.SS Examples
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBv2\fP
.sp
Produce a \fBv2\fP bundle using default options, including compression.
.TP
.B \fBnone\-v1\fP
.sp
Produce a \fBv1\fP bundle with no compression.
.TP
.B \fBzstd\-v2\fP
.sp
Produce a \fBv2\fP bundle with zstandard compression using default
settings.
.TP
.B \fBzstd\-v1\fP
.sp
This errors because \fBzstd\fP is not supported for \fBv1\fP types.
.TP
.B \fBnone\-streamv2\fP
.sp
Produce a \fBv2\fP streaming bundle with no compression.
.TP
.B \fBzstd\-v2;obsolescence=true;phases=true\fP
.sp
Produce a \fBv2\fP bundle with zstandard compression which includes
obsolescence markers and phases.
.UNINDENT
.SH COLORIZING OUTPUTS
.sp
Mercurial colorizes output from several commands.
.sp
For example, the diff command shows additions in green and deletions
in red, while the status command shows modified files in magenta. Many
other commands have analogous colors. It is possible to customize
these colors.
.sp
To enable color (default) whenever possible use:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[ui]
color = yes
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To disable color use:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[ui]
color = no
.ft P
.fi
.sp
See \%\fBhg help config.ui.color\fP\: for details.
.sp
The default pager on Windows does not support color, so enabling the pager
will effectively disable color.  See \%\fBhg help config.ui.paginate\fP\: to disable
the pager.  Alternately, MSYS and Cygwin shells provide \fIless\fP as a pager,
which can be configured to support ANSI color mode.  Windows 10 natively
supports ANSI color mode.
.SS Mode
.sp
Mercurial can use various systems to display color. The supported modes are
\fBansi\fP, \fBwin32\fP, and \fBterminfo\fP.  See \%\fBhg help config.color\fP\: for details
about how to control the mode.
.SS Effects
.sp
Other effects in addition to color, like bold and underlined text, are
also available. By default, the terminfo database is used to find the
terminal codes used to change color and effect.  If terminfo is not
available, then effects are rendered with the ECMA\-48 SGR control
function (aka ANSI escape codes).
.sp
The available effects in terminfo mode are \(aqblink\(aq, \(aqbold\(aq, \(aqdim\(aq,
\(aqinverse\(aq, \(aqinvisible\(aq, \(aqitalic\(aq, \(aqstandout\(aq, and \(aqunderline\(aq; in
ECMA\-48 mode, the options are \(aqbold\(aq, \(aqinverse\(aq, \(aqitalic\(aq, and
\(aqunderline\(aq.  How each is rendered depends on the terminal emulator.
Some may not be available for a given terminal type, and will be
silently ignored.
.sp
If the terminfo entry for your terminal is missing codes for an effect
or has the wrong codes, you can add or override those codes in your
configuration:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[color]
terminfo.dim = \eE[2m
.ft P
.fi
.sp
where \(aqE\(aq is substituted with an escape character.
.SS Labels
.sp
Text receives color effects depending on the labels that it has. Many
default Mercurial commands emit labelled text. You can also define
your own labels in templates using the label function, see \%\fBhg help
templates\fP\:. In order to receive effects, labels must have a dot, such
as \fIlog.secret\fP or \fIbranch.active\fP. A single portion of text may have
more than one label. In that case, effects given to the last label
will override any other effects. This includes the special "none"
effect, which nullifies other effects.
.sp
Labels are normally invisible. In order to see these labels and their
position in the text, use the global \-\-color=debug option. The same
anchor text may be associated to multiple labels, e.g.
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
[log.changeset changeset.secret|changeset:   22611:6f0a53c8f587]
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following are the default effects for some default labels. Default
effects may be overridden from your configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[color]
status.modified = blue bold underline red_background
status.added = green bold
status.removed = red bold blue_background
status.deleted = cyan bold underline
status.unknown = magenta bold underline
status.ignored = black bold

# \(aqnone\(aq turns off all effects
status.clean = none
status.copied = none

qseries.applied = blue bold underline
qseries.unapplied = black bold
qseries.missing = red bold

diff.diffline = bold
diff.extended = cyan bold
diff.file_a = red bold
diff.file_b = green bold
diff.hunk = magenta
diff.deleted = red
diff.inserted = green
diff.changed = white
diff.tab =
diff.trailingwhitespace = bold red_background

# Blank so it inherits the style of the surrounding label
changeset.public =
changeset.draft =
changeset.secret =

resolve.unresolved = red bold
resolve.resolved = green bold

bookmarks.active = green

branches.active = none
branches.closed = black bold
branches.current = green
branches.inactive = none

tags.normal = green
tags.local = black bold

rebase.rebased = blue
rebase.remaining = red bold

shelve.age = cyan
shelve.newest = green bold
shelve.name = blue bold

histedit.remaining = red bold
.ft P
.fi
.SS Custom colors
.sp
Because there are only eight standard colors, Mercurial allows you
to define color names for other color slots which might be available
for your terminal type, assuming terminfo mode.  For instance:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
color.brightblue = 12
color.pink = 207
color.orange = 202
.ft P
.fi
.sp
to set \(aqbrightblue\(aq to color slot 12 (useful for 16 color terminals
that have brighter colors defined in the upper eight) and, \(aqpink\(aq and
\(aqorange\(aq to colors in 256\-color xterm\(aqs default color cube.  These
defined colors may then be used as any of the pre\-defined eight,
including appending \(aq_background\(aq to set the background to that color.
.SH DATE FORMATS
.sp
Some commands allow the user to specify a date, e.g.:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
backout, commit, import, tag: Specify the commit date.
.IP \(bu 2
.
log, revert, update: Select revision(s) by date.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Many date formats are valid. Here are some examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBWed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006\fP (local timezone assumed)
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBDec 6 13:18 \-0600\fP (year assumed, time offset provided)
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBDec 6 13:18 UTC\fP (UTC and GMT are aliases for +0000)
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBDec 6\fP (midnight)
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB13:18\fP (today assumed)
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB3:39\fP (3:39AM assumed)
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB3:39pm\fP (15:39)
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB2006\-12\-06 13:18:29\fP (ISO 8601 format)
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB2006\-12\-6 13:18\fP
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB2006\-12\-6\fP
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB12\-6\fP
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB12/6\fP
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB12/6/6\fP (Dec 6 2006)
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBtoday\fP (midnight)
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fByesterday\fP (midnight)
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBnow\fP \- right now
.UNINDENT
.sp
Lastly, there is Mercurial\(aqs internal format:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB1165411109 0\fP (Wed Dec 6 13:18:29 2006 UTC)
.UNINDENT
.sp
This is the internal representation format for dates. The first number
is the number of seconds since the epoch (1970\-01\-01 00:00 UTC). The
second is the offset of the local timezone, in seconds west of UTC
(negative if the timezone is east of UTC).
.sp
The log command also accepts date ranges:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB<DATE\fP \- at or before a given date/time
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB>DATE\fP \- on or after a given date/time
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBDATE to DATE\fP \- a date range, inclusive
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fB\-DAYS\fP \- within a given number of days from today
.UNINDENT
.SH DEPRECATED FEATURES
.sp
Mercurial evolves over time, some features, options, commands may be replaced by
better and more secure alternatives. This topic will help you migrating your
existing usage and/or configuration to newer features.
.SS Commands
.sp
The following commands are still available but their use are not recommended:
.sp
\fBlocate\fP
.sp
This command has been replaced by \fIhg files\fP.
.sp
\fBparents\fP
.sp
This command can be replaced by \fIhg summary\fP or \fIhg log\fP with appropriate
revsets. See \fIhg help revsets\fP for more information.
.sp
\fBtip\fP
.sp
The recommended alternative is \fIhg heads\fP.
.SS Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBweb.allowpull\fP
.sp
Renamed to \fIallow\-pull\fP.
.TP
.B \fBweb.allow_push\fP
.sp
Renamed to \fIallow\-push\fP.
.UNINDENT
.SH DIFF FORMATS
.sp
Mercurial\(aqs default format for showing changes between two versions of
a file is compatible with the unified format of GNU diff, which can be
used by GNU patch and many other standard tools.
.sp
While this standard format is often enough, it does not encode the
following information:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
executable status and other permission bits
.IP \(bu 2
.
copy or rename information
.IP \(bu 2
.
changes in binary files
.IP \(bu 2
.
creation or deletion of empty files
.UNINDENT
.sp
Mercurial also supports the extended diff format from the git VCS
which addresses these limitations. The git diff format is not produced
by default because a few widespread tools still do not understand this
format.
.sp
This means that when generating diffs from a Mercurial repository
(e.g. with \%\fBhg export\fP\:), you should be careful about things like file
copies and renames or other things mentioned above, because when
applying a standard diff to a different repository, this extra
information is lost. Mercurial\(aqs internal operations (like push and
pull) are not affected by this, because they use an internal binary
format for communicating changes.
.sp
To make Mercurial produce the git extended diff format, use the \-\-git
option available for many commands, or set \(aqgit = True\(aq in the [diff]
section of your configuration file. You do not need to set this option
when importing diffs in this format or using them in the mq extension.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B HG
.
Path to the \(aqhg\(aq executable, automatically passed when running
hooks, extensions or external tools. If unset or empty, this is
the hg executable\(aqs name if it\(aqs frozen, or an executable named
\(aqhg\(aq (with %PATHEXT% [defaulting to COM/EXE/BAT/CMD] extensions on
Windows) is searched.
.TP
.B HGEDITOR
.
This is the name of the editor to run when committing. See EDITOR.
.sp
(deprecated, see \%\fBhg help config.ui.editor\fP\:)
.TP
.B HGENCODING
.
This overrides the default locale setting detected by Mercurial.
This setting is used to convert data including usernames,
changeset descriptions, tag names, and branches. This setting can
be overridden with the \-\-encoding command\-line option.
.TP
.B HGENCODINGMODE
.
This sets Mercurial\(aqs behavior for handling unknown characters
while transcoding user input. The default is "strict", which
causes Mercurial to abort if it can\(aqt map a character. Other
settings include "replace", which replaces unknown characters, and
"ignore", which drops them. This setting can be overridden with
the \-\-encodingmode command\-line option.
.TP
.B HGENCODINGAMBIGUOUS
.
This sets Mercurial\(aqs behavior for handling characters with
"ambiguous" widths like accented Latin characters with East Asian
fonts. By default, Mercurial assumes ambiguous characters are
narrow, set this variable to "wide" if such characters cause
formatting problems.
.TP
.B HGMERGE
.
An executable to use for resolving merge conflicts. The program
will be executed with three arguments: local file, remote file,
ancestor file.
.sp
(deprecated, see \%\fBhg help config.ui.merge\fP\:)
.TP
.B HGRCPATH
.
A list of files or directories to search for configuration
files. Item separator is ":" on Unix, ";" on Windows. If HGRCPATH
is not set, platform default search path is used. If empty, only
the .hg/hgrc from the current repository is read.
.sp
For each element in HGRCPATH:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
if it\(aqs a directory, all files ending with .rc are added
.IP \(bu 2
.
otherwise, the file itself will be added
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B HGRCSKIPREPO
.
When set, the .hg/hgrc from repositories are not read.
.TP
.B HGPLAIN
.
When set, this disables any configuration settings that might
change Mercurial\(aqs default output. This includes encoding,
defaults, verbose mode, debug mode, quiet mode, tracebacks, and
localization. This can be useful when scripting against Mercurial
in the face of existing user configuration.
.sp
In addition to the features disabled by \fBHGPLAIN=\fP, the following
values can be specified to adjust behavior:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB+strictflags\fP
.sp
Restrict parsing of command line flags.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Equivalent options set via command line flags or environment
variables are not overridden.
.sp
See \%\fBhg help scripting\fP\: for details.
.TP
.B HGPLAINEXCEPT
.
This is a comma\-separated list of features to preserve when
HGPLAIN is enabled. Currently the following values are supported:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBalias\fP
.sp
Don\(aqt remove aliases.
.TP
.B \fBcolor\fP
.sp
Don\(aqt disable colored output.
.TP
.B \fBi18n\fP
.sp
Preserve internationalization.
.TP
.B \fBrevsetalias\fP
.sp
Don\(aqt remove revset aliases.
.TP
.B \fBtemplatealias\fP
.sp
Don\(aqt remove template aliases.
.TP
.B \fBprogress\fP
.sp
Don\(aqt hide progress output.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Setting HGPLAINEXCEPT to anything (even an empty string) will
enable plain mode.
.TP
.B HGUSER
.
This is the string used as the author of a commit. If not set,
available values will be considered in this order:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
HGUSER (deprecated)
.IP \(bu 2
.
configuration files from the HGRCPATH
.IP \(bu 2
.
EMAIL
.IP \(bu 2
.
interactive prompt
.IP \(bu 2
.
LOGNAME (with \fB@hostname\fP appended)
.UNINDENT
.sp
(deprecated, see \%\fBhg help config.ui.username\fP\:)
.TP
.B EMAIL
.
May be used as the author of a commit; see HGUSER.
.TP
.B LOGNAME
.
May be used as the author of a commit; see HGUSER.
.TP
.B VISUAL
.
This is the name of the editor to use when committing. See EDITOR.
.TP
.B EDITOR
.
Sometimes Mercurial needs to open a text file in an editor for a
user to modify, for example when writing commit messages. The
editor it uses is determined by looking at the environment
variables HGEDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR, in that order. The first
non\-empty one is chosen. If all of them are empty, the editor
defaults to \(aqvi\(aq.
.TP
.B PYTHONPATH
.
This is used by Python to find imported modules and may need to be
set appropriately if this Mercurial is not installed system\-wide.
.UNINDENT
.SH SAFELY REWRITING HISTORY (EXPERIMENTAL)
.sp
Obsolescence markers make it possible to mark changesets that have been
deleted or superseded in a new version of the changeset.
.sp
Unlike the previous way of handling such changes, by stripping the old
changesets from the repository, obsolescence markers can be propagated
between repositories. This allows for a safe and simple way of exchanging
mutable history and altering it after the fact. Changeset phases are
respected, such that only draft and secret changesets can be altered (see
\%\fBhg help phases\fP\: for details).
.sp
Obsolescence is tracked using "obsolescence markers", a piece of metadata
tracking which changesets have been made obsolete, potential successors for
a given changeset, the moment the changeset was marked as obsolete, and the
user who performed the rewriting operation. The markers are stored
separately from standard changeset data can be exchanged without any of the
precursor changesets, preventing unnecessary exchange of obsolescence data.
.sp
The complete set of obsolescence markers describes a history of changeset
modifications that is orthogonal to the repository history of file
modifications. This changeset history allows for detection and automatic
resolution of edge cases arising from multiple users rewriting the same part
of history concurrently.
.SS Current feature status
.sp
This feature is still in development.
.SS Instability
.sp
Rewriting changesets might introduce instability.
.sp
There are two main kinds of instability: orphaning and diverging.
.sp
Orphans are changesets left behind when their ancestors are rewritten.
Divergence has two variants:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
Content\-divergence occurs when independent rewrites of the same changesets
lead to different results.
.IP \(bu 2
.
Phase\-divergence occurs when the old (obsolete) version of a changeset
becomes public.
.UNINDENT
.sp
It is possible to prevent local creation of orphans by using the following config:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[experimental]
evolution.createmarkers = true
evolution.exchange = true
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can also enable that option explicitly:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[experimental]
evolution.createmarkers = true
evolution.exchange = true
evolution.allowunstable = true
.ft P
.fi
.SH USING ADDITIONAL FEATURES
.sp
Mercurial has the ability to add new features through the use of
extensions. Extensions may add new commands, add options to
existing commands, change the default behavior of commands, or
implement hooks.
.sp
To enable the "foo" extension, either shipped with Mercurial or in the
Python search path, create an entry for it in your configuration file,
like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[extensions]
foo =
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You may also specify the full path to an extension:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[extensions]
myfeature = ~/.hgext/myfeature.py
.ft P
.fi
.sp
See \%\fBhg help config\fP\: for more information on configuration files.
.sp
Extensions are not loaded by default for a variety of reasons:
they can increase startup overhead; they may be meant for advanced
usage only; they may provide potentially dangerous abilities (such
as letting you destroy or modify history); they might not be ready
for prime time; or they may alter some usual behaviors of stock
Mercurial. It is thus up to the user to activate extensions as
needed.
.sp
To explicitly disable an extension enabled in a configuration file of
broader scope, prepend its path with !:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[extensions]
# disabling extension bar residing in /path/to/extension/bar.py
bar = !/path/to/extension/bar.py
# ditto, but no path was supplied for extension baz
baz = !
.ft P
.fi
.sp
disabled extensions:
.INDENT 0.0

.SH SPECIFYING FILE SETS
.sp
Mercurial supports a functional language for selecting a set of
files.
.sp
Like other file patterns, this pattern type is indicated by a prefix,
\(aqset:\(aq. The language supports a number of predicates which are joined
by infix operators. Parenthesis can be used for grouping.
.sp
Identifiers such as filenames or patterns must be quoted with single
or double quotes if they contain characters outside of
\fB[.*{}[]?/\e_a\-zA\-Z0\-9\ex80\-\exff]\fP or if they match one of the
predefined predicates. This generally applies to file patterns other
than globs and arguments for predicates. Pattern prefixes such as
\fBpath:\fP may be specified without quoting.
.sp
Special characters can be used in quoted identifiers by escaping them,
e.g., \fB\en\fP is interpreted as a newline. To prevent them from being
interpreted, strings can be prefixed with \fBr\fP, e.g. \fBr\(aq...\(aq\fP.
.sp
See also \%\fBhg help patterns\fP\:.
.SS Operators
.sp
There is a single prefix operator:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBnot x\fP
.sp
Files not in x. Short form is \fB! x\fP.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These are the supported infix operators:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBx and y\fP
.sp
The intersection of files in x and y. Short form is \fBx & y\fP.
.TP
.B \fBx or y\fP
.sp
The union of files in x and y. There are two alternative short
forms: \fBx | y\fP and \fBx + y\fP.
.TP
.B \fBx \- y\fP
.sp
Files in x but not in y.
.UNINDENT
.SS Predicates

.UNINDENT
.SH COMMAND\-LINE FLAGS
.sp
Most Mercurial commands accept various flags.
.SS Flag names
.sp
Flags for each command are listed in \%\fBhg help\fP\: for that command.
Additionally, some flags, such as \-\-repository, are global and can be used with
any command \- those are seen in \%\fBhg help \-v\fP\:, and can be specified before or
after the command.
.sp
Every flag has at least a long name, such as \-\-repository. Some flags may also
have a short one\-letter name, such as the equivalent \-R. Using the short or long
name is equivalent and has the same effect. The long name may be abbreviated to
any unambiguous prefix. For example, \%\fBhg commit \-\-amend\fP\: can be abbreviated
to \%\fBhg commit \-\-am\fP\:.
.sp
Flags that have a short name can also be bundled together \- for instance, to
specify both \-\-edit (short \-e) and \-\-interactive (short \-i), one could use:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg commit \-ei
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If any of the bundled flags takes a value (i.e. is not a boolean), it must be
last, followed by the value:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg commit \-im \(aqMessage\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.SS Flag types
.sp
Mercurial command\-line flags can be strings, numbers, booleans, or lists of
strings.
.SS Specifying flag values
.sp
The following syntaxes are allowed, assuming a flag \(aqflagname\(aq with short name
\(aqf\(aq:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-\-flagname=foo
\-\-flagname foo
\-f foo
\-ffoo
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This syntax applies to all non\-boolean flags (strings, numbers or lists).
.SS Specifying boolean flags
.sp
Boolean flags do not take a value parameter. To specify a boolean, use the flag
name to set it to true, or the same name prefixed with \(aqno\-\(aq to set it to
false:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg commit \-\-interactive
hg commit \-\-no\-interactive
.ft P
.fi
.SS Specifying list flags
.sp
List flags take multiple values. To specify them, pass the flag multiple times:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg files \-\-include mercurial \-\-include tests
.ft P
.fi
.SS Setting flag defaults
.sp
In order to set a default value for a flag in an hgrc file, it is recommended to
use aliases:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[alias]
commit = commit \-\-interactive
.ft P
.fi
.sp
For more information on hgrc files, see \%\fBhg help config\fP\:.
.SS Overriding flags on the command line
.sp
If the same non\-list flag is specified multiple times on the command line, the
latest specification is used:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg commit \-m "Ignored value" \-m "Used value"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This includes the use of aliases \- e.g., if one has:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[alias]
committemp = commit \-m "Ignored value"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
then the following command will override that \-m:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg committemp \-m "Used value"
.ft P
.fi
.SS Overriding flag defaults
.sp
Every flag has a default value, and you may also set your own defaults in hgrc
as described above.
Except for list flags, defaults can be overridden on the command line simply by
specifying the flag in that location.
.SS Hidden flags
.sp
Some flags are not shown in a command\(aqs help by default \- specifically, those
that are deemed to be experimental, deprecated or advanced. To show all flags,
add the \-\-verbose flag for the help command:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg help \-\-verbose commit
.ft P
.fi
.SH GLOSSARY
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Ancestor
.
Any changeset that can be reached by an unbroken chain of parent
changesets from a given changeset. More precisely, the ancestors
of a changeset can be defined by two properties: a parent of a
changeset is an ancestor, and a parent of an ancestor is an
ancestor. See also: \(aqDescendant\(aq.
.TP
.B Bookmark
.
Bookmarks are pointers to certain commits that move when
committing. They are similar to tags in that it is possible to use
bookmark names in all places where Mercurial expects a changeset
ID, e.g., with \%\fBhg update\fP\:. Unlike tags, bookmarks move along
when you make a commit.
.sp
Bookmarks can be renamed, copied and deleted. Bookmarks are local,
unless they are explicitly pushed or pulled between repositories.
Pushing and pulling bookmarks allow you to collaborate with others
on a branch without creating a named branch.
.TP
.B Branch
.
(Noun) A child changeset that has been created from a parent that
is not a head. These are known as topological branches, see
\(aqBranch, topological\(aq. If a topological branch is named, it becomes
a named branch. If a topological branch is not named, it becomes
an anonymous branch. See \(aqBranch, anonymous\(aq and \(aqBranch, named\(aq.
.sp
Branches may be created when changes are pulled from or pushed to
a remote repository, since new heads may be created by these
operations. Note that the term branch can also be used informally
to describe a development process in which certain development is
done independently of other development. This is sometimes done
explicitly with a named branch, but it can also be done locally,
using bookmarks or clones and anonymous branches.
.sp
Example: "The experimental branch."
.sp
(Verb) The action of creating a child changeset which results in
its parent having more than one child.
.sp
Example: "I\(aqm going to branch at X."
.TP
.B Branch, anonymous
.
Every time a new child changeset is created from a parent that is not
a head and the name of the branch is not changed, a new anonymous
branch is created.
.TP
.B Branch, closed
.
A named branch whose branch heads have all been closed.
.TP
.B Branch, default
.
The branch assigned to a changeset when no name has previously been
assigned.
.TP
.B Branch head
.
See \(aqHead, branch\(aq.
.TP
.B Branch, inactive
.
If a named branch has no topological heads, it is considered to be
inactive. As an example, a feature branch becomes inactive when it
is merged into the default branch. The \%\fBhg branches\fP\: command
shows inactive branches by default, though they can be hidden with
\%\fBhg branches \-\-active\fP\:.
.sp
NOTE: this concept is deprecated because it is too implicit.
Branches should now be explicitly closed using \%\fBhg commit
\-\-close\-branch\fP\: when they are no longer needed.
.TP
.B Branch, named
.
A collection of changesets which have the same branch name. By
default, children of a changeset in a named branch belong to the
same named branch. A child can be explicitly assigned to a
different branch. See \%\fBhg help branch\fP\:, \%\fBhg help branches\fP\: and
\%\fBhg commit \-\-close\-branch\fP\: for more information on managing
branches.
.sp
Named branches can be thought of as a kind of namespace, dividing
the collection of changesets that comprise the repository into a
collection of disjoint subsets. A named branch is not necessarily
a topological branch. If a new named branch is created from the
head of another named branch, or the default branch, but no
further changesets are added to that previous branch, then that
previous branch will be a branch in name only.
.TP
.B Branch tip
.
See \(aqTip, branch\(aq.
.TP
.B Branch, topological
.
Every time a new child changeset is created from a parent that is
not a head, a new topological branch is created. If a topological
branch is named, it becomes a named branch. If a topological
branch is not named, it becomes an anonymous branch of the
current, possibly default, branch.
.TP
.B Changelog
.
A record of the changesets in the order in which they were added
to the repository. This includes details such as changeset id,
author, commit message, date, and list of changed files.
.TP
.B Changeset
.
A snapshot of the state of the repository used to record a change.
.TP
.B Changeset, child
.
The converse of parent changeset: if P is a parent of C, then C is
a child of P. There is no limit to the number of children that a
changeset may have.
.TP
.B Changeset id
.
A SHA\-1 hash that uniquely identifies a changeset. It may be
represented as either a "long" 40 hexadecimal digit string, or a
"short" 12 hexadecimal digit string.
.TP
.B Changeset, merge
.
A changeset with two parents. This occurs when a merge is
committed.
.TP
.B Changeset, parent
.
A revision upon which a child changeset is based. Specifically, a
parent changeset of a changeset C is a changeset whose node
immediately precedes C in the DAG. Changesets have at most two
parents.
.TP
.B Checkout
.
(Noun) The working directory being updated to a specific
revision. This use should probably be avoided where possible, as
changeset is much more appropriate than checkout in this context.
.sp
Example: "I\(aqm using checkout X."
.sp
(Verb) Updating the working directory to a specific changeset. See
\%\fBhg help update\fP\:.
.sp
Example: "I\(aqm going to check out changeset X."
.TP
.B Child changeset
.
See \(aqChangeset, child\(aq.
.TP
.B Close changeset
.
See \(aqHead, closed branch\(aq.
.TP
.B Closed branch
.
See \(aqBranch, closed\(aq.
.TP
.B Clone
.
(Noun) An entire or partial copy of a repository. The partial
clone must be in the form of a revision and its ancestors.
.sp
Example: "Is your clone up to date?"
.sp
(Verb) The process of creating a clone, using \%\fBhg clone\fP\:.
.sp
Example: "I\(aqm going to clone the repository."
.TP
.B Closed branch head
.
See \(aqHead, closed branch\(aq.
.TP
.B Commit
.
(Noun) A synonym for changeset.
.sp
Example: "Is the bug fixed in your recent commit?"
.sp
(Verb) The act of recording changes to a repository. When files
are committed in a working directory, Mercurial finds the
differences between the committed files and their parent
changeset, creating a new changeset in the repository.
.sp
Example: "You should commit those changes now."
.TP
.B Cset
.
A common abbreviation of the term changeset.
.TP
.B DAG
.
The repository of changesets of a distributed version control
system (DVCS) can be described as a directed acyclic graph (DAG),
consisting of nodes and edges, where nodes correspond to
changesets and edges imply a parent \-> child relation. This graph
can be visualized by graphical tools such as \%\fBhg log \-\-graph\fP\:. In
Mercurial, the DAG is limited by the requirement for children to
have at most two parents.
.TP
.B Deprecated
.
Feature removed from documentation, but not scheduled for removal.
.TP
.B Default branch
.
See \(aqBranch, default\(aq.
.TP
.B Descendant
.
Any changeset that can be reached by a chain of child changesets
from a given changeset. More precisely, the descendants of a
changeset can be defined by two properties: the child of a
changeset is a descendant, and the child of a descendant is a
descendant. See also: \(aqAncestor\(aq.
.TP
.B Diff
.
(Noun) The difference between the contents and attributes of files
in two changesets or a changeset and the current working
directory. The difference is usually represented in a standard
form called a "diff" or "patch". The "git diff" format is used
when the changes include copies, renames, or changes to file
attributes, none of which can be represented/handled by classic
"diff" and "patch".
.sp
Example: "Did you see my correction in the diff?"
.sp
(Verb) Diffing two changesets is the action of creating a diff or
patch.
.sp
Example: "If you diff with changeset X, you will see what I mean."
.TP
.B Directory, working
.
The working directory represents the state of the files tracked by
Mercurial, that will be recorded in the next commit. The working
directory initially corresponds to the snapshot at an existing
changeset, known as the parent of the working directory. See
\(aqParent, working directory\(aq. The state may be modified by changes
to the files introduced manually or by a merge. The repository
metadata exists in the .hg directory inside the working directory.
.TP
.B Draft
.
Changesets in the draft phase have not been shared with publishing
repositories and may thus be safely changed by history\-modifying
extensions. See \%\fBhg help phases\fP\:.
.TP
.B Experimental
.
Feature that may change or be removed at a later date.
.TP
.B Graph
.
See DAG and \%\fBhg log \-\-graph\fP\:.
.TP
.B Head
.
The term \(aqhead\(aq may be used to refer to both a branch head or a
repository head, depending on the context. See \(aqHead, branch\(aq and
\(aqHead, repository\(aq for specific definitions.
.sp
Heads are where development generally takes place and are the
usual targets for update and merge operations.
.TP
.B Head, branch
.
A changeset with no descendants on the same named branch.
.TP
.B Head, closed branch
.
A changeset that marks a head as no longer interesting. The closed
head is no longer listed by \%\fBhg heads\fP\:. A branch is considered
closed when all its heads are closed and consequently is not
listed by \%\fBhg branches\fP\:.
.sp
Closed heads can be re\-opened by committing new changeset as the
child of the changeset that marks a head as closed.
.TP
.B Head, repository
.
A topological head which has not been closed.
.TP
.B Head, topological
.
A changeset with no children in the repository.
.TP
.B History, immutable
.
Once committed, changesets cannot be altered.  Extensions which
appear to change history actually create new changesets that
replace existing ones, and then destroy the old changesets. Doing
so in public repositories can result in old changesets being
reintroduced to the repository.
.TP
.B History, rewriting
.
The changesets in a repository are immutable. However, extensions
to Mercurial can be used to alter the repository, usually in such
a way as to preserve changeset contents.
.TP
.B Immutable history
.
See \(aqHistory, immutable\(aq.
.TP
.B Merge changeset
.
See \(aqChangeset, merge\(aq.
.TP
.B Manifest
.
Each changeset has a manifest, which is the list of files that are
tracked by the changeset.
.TP
.B Merge
.
Used to bring together divergent branches of work. When you update
to a changeset and then merge another changeset, you bring the
history of the latter changeset into your working directory. Once
conflicts are resolved (and marked), this merge may be committed
as a merge changeset, bringing two branches together in the DAG.
.TP
.B Named branch
.
See \(aqBranch, named\(aq.
.TP
.B Null changeset
.
The empty changeset. It is the parent state of newly\-initialized
repositories and repositories with no checked out revision. It is
thus the parent of root changesets and the effective ancestor when
merging unrelated changesets. Can be specified by the alias \(aqnull\(aq
or by the changeset ID \(aq000000000000\(aq.
.TP
.B Parent
.
See \(aqChangeset, parent\(aq.
.TP
.B Parent changeset
.
See \(aqChangeset, parent\(aq.
.TP
.B Parent, working directory
.
The working directory parent reflects a virtual revision which is
the child of the changeset (or two changesets with an uncommitted
merge) shown by \%\fBhg parents\fP\:. This is changed with
\%\fBhg update\fP\:. Other commands to see the working directory parent
are \%\fBhg summary\fP\: and \%\fBhg id\fP\:. Can be specified by the alias ".".
.TP
.B Patch
.
(Noun) The product of a diff operation.
.sp
Example: "I\(aqve sent you my patch."
.sp
(Verb) The process of using a patch file to transform one
changeset into another.
.sp
Example: "You will need to patch that revision."
.TP
.B Phase
.
A per\-changeset state tracking how the changeset has been or
should be shared. See \%\fBhg help phases\fP\:.
.TP
.B Public
.
Changesets in the public phase have been shared with publishing
repositories and are therefore considered immutable. See \%\fBhg help
phases\fP\:.
.TP
.B Pull
.
An operation in which changesets in a remote repository which are
not in the local repository are brought into the local
repository. Note that this operation without special arguments
only updates the repository, it does not update the files in the
working directory. See \%\fBhg help pull\fP\:.
.TP
.B Push
.
An operation in which changesets in a local repository which are
not in a remote repository are sent to the remote repository. Note
that this operation only adds changesets which have been committed
locally to the remote repository. Uncommitted changes are not
sent. See \%\fBhg help push\fP\:.
.TP
.B Repository
.
The metadata describing all recorded states of a collection of
files. Each recorded state is represented by a changeset. A
repository is usually (but not always) found in the \fB.hg\fP
subdirectory of a working directory. Any recorded state can be
recreated by "updating" a working directory to a specific
changeset.
.TP
.B Repository head
.
See \(aqHead, repository\(aq.
.TP
.B Revision
.
A state of the repository at some point in time. Earlier revisions
can be updated to by using \%\fBhg update\fP\:.  See also \(aqRevision
number\(aq; See also \(aqChangeset\(aq.
.TP
.B Revision number
.
This integer uniquely identifies a changeset in a specific
repository. It represents the order in which changesets were added
to a repository, starting with revision number 0. Note that the
revision number may be different in each clone of a repository. To
identify changesets uniquely between different clones, see
\(aqChangeset id\(aq.
.TP
.B Revlog
.
History storage mechanism used by Mercurial. It is a form of delta
encoding, with occasional full revision of data followed by delta
of each successive revision. It includes data and an index
pointing to the data.
.TP
.B Rewriting history
.
See \(aqHistory, rewriting\(aq.
.TP
.B Root
.
A changeset that has only the null changeset as its parent. Most
repositories have only a single root changeset.
.TP
.B Secret
.
Changesets in the secret phase may not be shared via push, pull,
or clone. See \%\fBhg help phases\fP\:.
.TP
.B Tag
.
An alternative name given to a changeset. Tags can be used in all

.SH SYNTAX FOR MERCURIAL IGNORE FILES
.SS Synopsis
.sp
The Mercurial system uses a file called \fB.hgignore\fP in the root
directory of a repository to control its behavior when it searches
for files that it is not currently tracking.
.SS Description
.sp
The working directory of a Mercurial repository will often contain
files that should not be tracked by Mercurial. These include backup
files created by editors and build products created by compilers.
These files can be ignored by listing them in a \fB.hgignore\fP file in
the root of the working directory. The \fB.hgignore\fP file must be
created manually. It is typically put under version control, so that
the settings will propagate to other repositories with push and pull.
.sp
An untracked file is ignored if its path relative to the repository
root directory, or any prefix path of that path, is matched against
any pattern in \fB.hgignore\fP.
.sp
For example, say we have an untracked file, \fBfile.c\fP, at
\fBa/b/file.c\fP inside our repository. Mercurial will ignore \fBfile.c\fP
if any pattern in \fB.hgignore\fP matches \fBa/b/file.c\fP, \fBa/b\fP or \fBa\fP.
.sp
In addition, a Mercurial configuration file can reference a set of
per\-user or global ignore files. See the \fBignore\fP configuration
key on the \fB[ui]\fP section of \%\fBhg help config\fP\: for details of how to
configure these files.
.sp
To control Mercurial\(aqs handling of files that it manages, many
commands support the \fB\-I\fP and \fB\-X\fP options; see
\%\fBhg help <command>\fP\: and \%\fBhg help patterns\fP\: for details.
.sp
Files that are already tracked are not affected by .hgignore, even
if they appear in .hgignore. An untracked file X can be explicitly
added with \%\fBhg add X\fP\:, even if X would be excluded by a pattern
in .hgignore.
.SS Syntax
.sp
An ignore file is a plain text file consisting of a list of patterns,
with one pattern per line. Empty lines are skipped. The \fB#\fP
character is treated as a comment character, and the \fB\e\fP character
is treated as an escape character.
.sp
Mercurial supports several pattern syntaxes. The default syntax used
is Python/Perl\-style regular expressions.
.sp
To change the syntax used, use a line of the following form:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
syntax: NAME
.ft P
.fi
.sp
where \fBNAME\fP is one of the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBregexp\fP
.sp
Regular expression, Python/Perl syntax.
.TP
.B \fBglob\fP
.sp
Shell\-style glob.
.TP
.B \fBrootglob\fP
.sp
A variant of \fBglob\fP that is rooted (see below).
.UNINDENT
.sp
The chosen syntax stays in effect when parsing all patterns that
follow, until another syntax is selected.
.sp
Neither \fBglob\fP nor regexp patterns are rooted. A glob\-syntax
pattern of the form \fB*.c\fP will match a file ending in \fB.c\fP in any
directory, and a regexp pattern of the form \fB\e.c$\fP will do the
same. To root a regexp pattern, start it with \fB^\fP. To get the same
effect with glob\-syntax, you have to use \fBrootglob\fP.
.sp
Subdirectories can have their own .hgignore settings by adding
\fBsubinclude:path/to/subdir/.hgignore\fP to the root \fB.hgignore\fP. See
\%\fBhg help patterns\fP\: for details on \fBsubinclude:\fP and \fBinclude:\fP.
.IP Note
.
Patterns specified in other than \fB.hgignore\fP are always rooted.
Please see \%\fBhg help patterns\fP\: for details.
.RE
.SS Example
.sp
Here is an example ignore file.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# use glob syntax.
syntax: glob

*.elc
*.pyc
*~

# switch to regexp syntax.
syntax: regexp
^\e.pc/
.ft P
.fi
.SS Debugging
.sp
Use the \fBdebugignore\fP command to see if and why a file is ignored, or to
see the combined ignore pattern. See \%\fBhg help debugignore\fP\: for details.
.SH CONFIGURING HGWEB
.sp
Mercurial\(aqs internal web server, hgweb, can serve either a single
repository, or a tree of repositories. In the second case, repository
paths and global options can be defined using a dedicated
configuration file common to \%\fBhg serve\fP\:, \fBhgweb.wsgi\fP,
\fBhgweb.cgi\fP and \fBhgweb.fcgi\fP.
.sp
This file uses the same syntax as other Mercurial configuration files
but recognizes only the following sections:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
web
.IP \(bu 2
.
paths
.IP \(bu 2
.
collections
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBweb\fP options are thoroughly described in \%\fBhg help config\fP\:.
.sp
The \fBpaths\fP section maps URL paths to paths of repositories in the
filesystem. hgweb will not expose the filesystem directly \- only
Mercurial repositories can be published and only according to the
configuration.
.sp
The left hand side is the path in the URL. Note that hgweb reserves
subpaths like \fBrev\fP or \fBfile\fP, try using different names for
nested repositories to avoid confusing effects.
.sp
The right hand side is the path in the filesystem. If the specified
path ends with \fB*\fP or \fB**\fP the filesystem will be searched
recursively for repositories below that point.
With \fB*\fP it will not recurse into the repositories it finds (except for
\fB.hg/patches\fP).
With \fB**\fP it will also search inside repository working directories
and possibly find subrepositories.
.sp
In this example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[paths]
/projects/a = /srv/tmprepos/a
/projects/b = c:/repos/b
/ = /srv/repos/*
/user/bob = /home/bob/repos/**
.ft P
.fi
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
The first two entries make two repositories in different directories
appear under the same directory in the web interface
.IP \(bu 2
.
The third entry will publish every Mercurial repository found in
\fB/srv/repos/\fP, for instance the repository \fB/srv/repos/quux/\fP
will appear as \fBhttp://server/quux/\fP
.IP \(bu 2
.
The fourth entry will publish both \fBhttp://server/user/bob/quux/\fP
and \fBhttp://server/user/bob/quux/testsubrepo/\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBcollections\fP section is deprecated and has been superseded by
\fBpaths\fP.
.SS URLs and Common Arguments
.sp
URLs under each repository have the form \fB/{command}[/{arguments}]\fP
where \fB{command}\fP represents the name of a command or handler and
\fB{arguments}\fP represents any number of additional URL parameters
to that command.
.sp
The web server has a default style associated with it. Styles map to
a collection of named templates. Each template is used to render a
specific piece of data, such as a changeset or diff.
.sp
The style for the current request can be overridden two ways. First,
if \fB{command}\fP contains a hyphen (\fB\-\fP), the text before the hyphen
defines the style. For example, \fB/atom\-log\fP will render the \fBlog\fP
command handler with the \fBatom\fP style. The second way to set the
style is with the \fBstyle\fP query string argument. For example,
\fB/log?style=atom\fP. The hyphenated URL parameter is preferred.
.sp
Not all templates are available for all styles. Attempting to use
a style that doesn\(aqt have all templates defined may result in an error
rendering the page.
.sp
Many commands take a \fB{revision}\fP URL parameter. This defines the
changeset to operate on. This is commonly specified as the short,
12 digit hexadecimal abbreviation for the full 40 character unique
revision identifier. However, any value described by
\%\fBhg help revisions\fP\: typically works.
.SS Commands and URLs
.sp
The following web commands and their URLs are available:
.SS /annotate/{revision}/{path}
.sp
Show changeset information for each line in a file.
.sp
The \fBignorews\fP, \fBignorewsamount\fP, \fBignorewseol\fP, and
\fBignoreblanklines\fP query string arguments have the same meaning as
their \fB[annotate]\fP config equivalents. It uses the hgrc boolean
parsing logic to interpret the value. e.g. \fB0\fP and \fBfalse\fP are
false and \fB1\fP and \fBtrue\fP are true. If not defined, the server
default settings are used.
.sp
The \fBfileannotate\fP template is rendered.
.SS /archive/{revision}.{format}[/{path}]
.sp
Obtain an archive of repository content.
.sp
The content and type of the archive is defined by a URL path parameter.
\fBformat\fP is the file extension of the archive type to be generated. e.g.
\fBzip\fP or \fBtar.bz2\fP. Not all archive types may be allowed by your
server configuration.
.sp
The optional \fBpath\fP URL parameter controls content to include in the
archive. If omitted, every file in the specified revision is present in the
archive. If included, only the specified file or contents of the specified
directory will be included in the archive.
.sp
No template is used for this handler. Raw, binary content is generated.
.SS /bookmarks
.sp
Show information about bookmarks.
.sp
No arguments are accepted.
.sp
The \fBbookmarks\fP template is rendered.
.SS /branches
.sp
Show information about branches.
.sp
All known branches are contained in the output, even closed branches.
.sp
No arguments are accepted.
.sp
The \fBbranches\fP template is rendered.
.SS /changelog[/{revision}]
.sp
Show information about multiple changesets.
.sp
If the optional \fBrevision\fP URL argument is absent, information about
all changesets starting at \fBtip\fP will be rendered. If the \fBrevision\fP
argument is present, changesets will be shown starting from the specified
revision.
.sp
If \fBrevision\fP is absent, the \fBrev\fP query string argument may be
defined. This will perform a search for changesets.
.sp
The argument for \fBrev\fP can be a single revision, a revision set,
or a literal keyword to search for in changeset data (equivalent to
\%\fBhg log \-k\fP\:).
.sp
The \fBrevcount\fP query string argument defines the maximum numbers of
changesets to render.
.sp
For non\-searches, the \fBchangelog\fP template will be rendered.
.SS /changeset[/{revision}]
.sp
Show information about a single changeset.
.sp
A URL path argument is the changeset identifier to show. See \fBhg help
revisions\fP for possible values. If not defined, the \fBtip\fP changeset
will be shown.
.sp
The \fBchangeset\fP template is rendered. Contents of the \fBchangesettag\fP,
\fBchangesetbookmark\fP, \fBfilenodelink\fP, \fBfilenolink\fP, and the many
templates related to diffs may all be used to produce the output.
.SS /comparison/{revision}/{path}
.sp
Show a comparison between the old and new versions of a file from changes
made on a particular revision.
.sp
This is similar to the \fBdiff\fP handler. However, this form features
a split or side\-by\-side diff rather than a unified diff.
.sp
The \fBcontext\fP query string argument can be used to control the lines of
context in the diff.
.sp
The \fBfilecomparison\fP template is rendered.
.SS /diff/{revision}/{path}
.sp
Show how a file changed in a particular commit.
.sp
The \fBfilediff\fP template is rendered.
.sp
This handler is registered under both the \fB/diff\fP and \fB/filediff\fP
paths. \fB/diff\fP is used in modern code.
.SS /file/{revision}[/{path}]
.sp
Show information about a directory or file in the repository.
.sp
Info about the \fBpath\fP given as a URL parameter will be rendered.
.sp
If \fBpath\fP is a directory, information about the entries in that
directory will be rendered. This form is equivalent to the \fBmanifest\fP
handler.
.sp
If \fBpath\fP is a file, information about that file will be shown via
the \fBfilerevision\fP template.
.sp
If \fBpath\fP is not defined, information about the root directory will
be rendered.
.SS /diff/{revision}/{path}
.sp
Show how a file changed in a particular commit.
.sp
The \fBfilediff\fP template is rendered.
.sp
This handler is registered under both the \fB/diff\fP and \fB/filediff\fP
paths. \fB/diff\fP is used in modern code.
.SS /filelog/{revision}/{path}
.sp
Show information about the history of a file in the repository.
.sp
The \fBrevcount\fP query string argument can be defined to control the
maximum number of entries to show.
.sp
The \fBfilelog\fP template will be rendered.
.SS /graph[/{revision}]
.sp
Show information about the graphical topology of the repository.
.sp
Information rendered by this handler can be used to create visual
representations of repository topology.
.sp
The \fBrevision\fP URL parameter controls the starting changeset. If it\(aqs
absent, the default is \fBtip\fP.
.sp
The \fBrevcount\fP query string argument can define the number of changesets
to show information for.
.sp
The \fBgraphtop\fP query string argument can specify the starting changeset
for producing \fBjsdata\fP variable that is used for rendering graph in
JavaScript. By default it has the same value as \fBrevision\fP.
.sp
This handler will render the \fBgraph\fP template.
.SS /help[/{topic}]
.sp
Render help documentation.
.sp
This web command is roughly equivalent to \%\fBhg help\fP\:. If a \fBtopic\fP
is defined, that help topic will be rendered. If not, an index of
available help topics will be rendered.
.sp
The \fBhelp\fP template will be rendered when requesting help for a topic.
\fBhelptopics\fP will be rendered for the index of help topics.
.SS /log[/{revision}[/{path}]]
.sp
Show repository or file history.
.sp
For URLs of the form \fB/log/{revision}\fP, a list of changesets starting at
the specified changeset identifier is shown. If \fB{revision}\fP is not
defined, the default is \fBtip\fP. This form is equivalent to the
\fBchangelog\fP handler.
.sp
For URLs of the form \fB/log/{revision}/{file}\fP, the history for a specific
file will be shown. This form is equivalent to the \fBfilelog\fP handler.
.SS /manifest[/{revision}[/{path}]]
.sp
Show information about a directory.
.sp
If the URL path arguments are omitted, information about the root
directory for the \fBtip\fP changeset will be shown.
.sp
Because this handler can only show information for directories, it
is recommended to use the \fBfile\fP handler instead, as it can handle both
directories and files.
.sp
The \fBmanifest\fP template will be rendered for this handler.
.SS /changeset[/{revision}]
.sp
Show information about a single changeset.
.sp
A URL path argument is the changeset identifier to show. See \fBhg help
revisions\fP for possible values. If not defined, the \fBtip\fP changeset
will be shown.
.sp
The \fBchangeset\fP template is rendered. Contents of the \fBchangesettag\fP,
\fBchangesetbookmark\fP, \fBfilenodelink\fP, \fBfilenolink\fP, and the many
templates related to diffs may all be used to produce the output.
.SS /shortlog
.sp
Show basic information about a set of changesets.
.sp
This accepts the same parameters as the \fBchangelog\fP handler. The only
difference is the \fBshortlog\fP template will be rendered instead of the
\fBchangelog\fP template.
.SS /summary
.sp
Show a summary of repository state.
.sp
Information about the latest changesets, bookmarks, tags, and branches
is captured by this handler.
.sp
The \fBsummary\fP template is rendered.
.SS /tags
.sp
Show information about tags.
.sp
No arguments are accepted.
.sp
The \fBtags\fP template is rendered.

.SH MERGE TOOLS
.sp
To merge files Mercurial uses merge tools.
.sp
A merge tool combines two different versions of a file into a merged
file. Merge tools are given the two files and the greatest common
ancestor of the two file versions, so they can determine the changes
made on both branches.
.sp
Merge tools are used both for \%\fBhg resolve\fP\:, \%\fBhg merge\fP\:, \%\fBhg update\fP\:,
\%\fBhg backout\fP\: and in several extensions.
.sp
Usually, the merge tool tries to automatically reconcile the files by
combining all non\-overlapping changes that occurred separately in
the two different evolutions of the same initial base file. Furthermore, some
interactive merge programs make it easier to manually resolve
conflicting merges, either in a graphical way, or by inserting some
conflict markers. Mercurial does not include any interactive merge
programs but relies on external tools for that.
.SS Available merge tools
.sp
External merge tools and their properties are configured in the
merge\-tools configuration section \- see hgrc(5) \- but they can often just
be named by their executable.
.sp
A merge tool is generally usable if its executable can be found on the
system and if it can handle the merge. The executable is found if it
is an absolute or relative executable path or the name of an
application in the executable search path. The tool is assumed to be
able to handle the merge if it can handle symlinks if the file is a
symlink, if it can handle binary files if the file is binary, and if a
GUI is available if the tool requires a GUI.
.sp
There are some internal merge tools which can be used. The internal
merge tools are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB:dump\fP
.sp
Creates three versions of the files to merge, containing the
contents of local, other and base. These files can then be used to
perform a merge manually. If the file to be merged is named
\fBa.txt\fP, these files will accordingly be named \fBa.txt.local\fP,
\fBa.txt.other\fP and \fBa.txt.base\fP and they will be placed in the
same directory as \fBa.txt\fP.
.sp
This implies premerge. Therefore, files aren\(aqt dumped, if premerge
runs successfully. Use :forcedump to forcibly write files out.
.sp
(actual capabilities: binary, symlink)
.TP
.B \fB:fail\fP
.sp
Rather than attempting to merge files that were modified on both
branches, it marks them as unresolved. The resolve command must be
used to resolve these conflicts.
.sp
(actual capabilities: binary, symlink)
.TP
.B \fB:forcedump\fP
.sp
Creates three versions of the files as same as :dump, but omits premerge.
.sp
(actual capabilities: binary, symlink)
.TP
.B \fB:local\fP
.sp
Uses the local \fIp1()\fP version of files as the merged version.
.sp
(actual capabilities: binary, symlink)
.TP
.B \fB:merge\fP
.sp
Uses the internal non\-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging
files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave markers in
the partially merged file. Markers will have two sections, one for each side
of merge.
.TP
.B \fB:merge\-local\fP
.sp
Like :merge, but resolve all conflicts non\-interactively in favor
of the local \fIp1()\fP changes.
.TP
.B \fB:merge\-other\fP
.sp
Like :merge, but resolve all conflicts non\-interactively in favor
of the other \fIp2()\fP changes.
.TP
.B \fB:merge3\fP
.sp
Uses the internal non\-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging
files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave markers in
the partially merged file. Marker will have three sections, one from each
side of the merge and one for the base content.
.TP
.B \fB:mergediff\fP
.sp
Uses the internal non\-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging
files. It will fail if there are any conflicts and leave markers in
the partially merged file. The marker will have two sections, one with the
content from one side of the merge, and one with a diff from the base
content to the content on the other side. (experimental)
.TP
.B \fB:other\fP
.sp
Uses the other \fIp2()\fP version of files as the merged version.
.sp
(actual capabilities: binary, symlink)
.TP
.B \fB:prompt\fP
.sp
Asks the user which of the local \fIp1()\fP or the other \fIp2()\fP version to
keep as the merged version.
.sp
(actual capabilities: binary, symlink)
.TP
.B \fB:tagmerge\fP
.sp
Uses the internal tag merge algorithm (experimental).
.TP
.B \fB:union\fP
.sp
Uses the internal non\-interactive simple merge algorithm for merging
files. It will use both local and other sides for conflict regions by
adding local on top of other.
No markers are inserted.
.TP
.B \fB:union\-other\-first\fP
.sp
Like :union, but add other on top of local.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Internal tools are always available and do not require a GUI but will
by default not handle symlinks or binary files. See next section for
detail about "actual capabilities" described above.
.SS Choosing a merge tool
.sp
Mercurial uses these rules when deciding which merge tool to use:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
.
If a tool has been specified with the \-\-tool option to merge or resolve, it
is used.  If it is the name of a tool in the merge\-tools configuration, its
configuration is used. Otherwise the specified tool must be executable by
the shell.
.IP 2. 3
.
If the \fBHGMERGE\fP environment variable is present, its value is used and
must be executable by the shell.
.IP 3. 3
.
If the filename of the file to be merged matches any of the patterns in the
merge\-patterns configuration section, the first usable merge tool
corresponding to a matching pattern is used.
.IP 4. 3
.
If ui.merge is set it will be considered next. If the value is not the name
of a configured tool, the specified value is used and must be executable by
the shell. Otherwise the named tool is used if it is usable.
.IP 5. 3
.
If any usable merge tools are present in the merge\-tools configuration
section, the one with the highest priority is used.
.IP 6. 3
.
If a program named \fBhgmerge\fP can be found on the system, it is used \- but
it will by default not be used for symlinks and binary files.
.IP 7. 3
.
If the file to be merged is not binary and is not a symlink, then
internal \fB:merge\fP is used.
.IP 8. 3
.
Otherwise, \fB:prompt\fP is used.

compatibility.
.IP Note
.
After selecting a merge program, Mercurial will by default attempt
to merge the files using a simple merge algorithm first. Only if it doesn\(aqt
succeed because of conflicting changes will Mercurial actually execute the
merge program. Whether to use the simple merge algorithm first can be
controlled by the premerge setting of the merge tool. Premerge is enabled by
default unless the file is binary or a symlink.
.RE
.sp
See the merge\-tools and ui sections of hgrc(5) for details on the
configuration of merge tools.
.SH PAGER SUPPORT
.sp
Some Mercurial commands can produce a lot of output, and Mercurial will
attempt to use a pager to make those commands more pleasant.
.sp
To set the pager that should be used, set the application variable:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[pager]
pager = less \-FRX
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If no pager is set in the user or repository configuration, Mercurial uses the
environment variable $PAGER. If $PAGER is not set, pager.pager from the default
or system configuration is used. If none of these are set, a default pager will
be used, typically \fIless\fP on Unix and \fImore\fP on Windows.
.sp
On Windows, \fImore\fP is not color aware, so using it effectively disables color.
MSYS and Cygwin shells provide \fIless\fP as a pager, which can be configured to
support ANSI color codes.  See \%\fBhg help config.color.pagermode\fP\: to configure
the color mode when invoking a pager.
.sp
You can disable the pager for certain commands by adding them to the
pager.ignore list:
.sp
.nf

.SH FILE NAME PATTERNS
.sp
Mercurial accepts several notations for identifying one or more files
at a time.
.sp
By default, Mercurial treats filenames verbatim without pattern
matching, relative to the current working directory. Note that your
system shell might perform pattern matching of its own before passing
filenames into Mercurial.
.sp
Alternate pattern notations must be specified explicitly.
.IP Note
.
Patterns specified in \fB.hgignore\fP are not rooted.
Please see \%\fBhg help hgignore\fP\: for details.
.RE
.sp
To use a plain path name without any pattern matching, start it with
\fBpath:\fP. These path names must completely match starting at the
current repository root, and when the path points to a directory, it is matched
recursively. To match all files in a directory non\-recursively (not including
any files in subdirectories), \fBrootfilesin:\fP can be used, specifying an
absolute path (relative to the repository root). To match a single file exactly,
relative to the repository root, you can use \fBfilepath:\fP.
.sp
To use an extended glob, start a name with \fBglob:\fP. Globs are rooted
at the current directory; a glob such as \fB*.c\fP will only match files
in the current directory ending with \fB.c\fP. \fBrootglob:\fP can be used
instead of \fBglob:\fP for a glob that is rooted at the root of the
repository.
.sp
The supported glob syntax extensions are \fB**\fP to match any string
across path separators and \fB{a,b}\fP to mean "a or b".
.sp
To use a Perl/Python regular expression, start a name with \fBre:\fP.
Regexp pattern matching is anchored at the root of the repository.
.sp
To read name patterns from a file, use \fBlistfile:\fP or \fBlistfile0:\fP.
The latter expects null delimited patterns while the former expects line
feeds. Each string read from the file is itself treated as a file
pattern.
.sp
To read a set of patterns from a file, use \fBinclude:\fP or \fBsubinclude:\fP.
\fBinclude:\fP will use all the patterns from the given file and treat them as if
they had been passed in manually.  \fBsubinclude:\fP will only apply the patterns
against files that are under the subinclude file\(aqs directory. See \%\fBhg help
hgignore\fP\: for details on the format of these files.
.sp
All patterns, except for \fBglob:\fP specified in command line (not for
\fB\-I\fP or \fB\-X\fP options), can match also against directories: files
under matched directories are treated as matched.
For \fB\-I\fP and \fB\-X\fP options, \fBglob:\fP will match directories recursively.
.sp
Plain examples:
.sp
.nf

path:some/path                a file or directory named "some/path"
filepath:some/path/to/a/file  exactly a single file named

                              of the repository
rootfilesin:foo/bar           the files in a directory called foo/bar, but

.SH WORKING WITH PHASES
.SS What are phases?
.sp
Phases are a system for tracking which changesets have been or should
be shared. This helps prevent common mistakes when modifying history
(for instance, with the mq or rebase extensions).
.sp
Each changeset in a repository is in one of the following phases:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
public : changeset is visible on a public server
.IP \(bu 2
.
draft : changeset is not yet published
.IP \(bu 2
.
secret : changeset should not be pushed, pulled, or cloned
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These phases are ordered (public < draft < secret) and no changeset
can be in a lower phase than its ancestors. For instance, if a
changeset is public, all its ancestors are also public. Lastly,
changeset phases should only be changed towards the public phase.
.SS How are phases managed?
.sp
For the most part, phases should work transparently. By default, a
changeset is created in the draft phase and is moved into the public
phase when it is pushed to another repository.
.sp
Once changesets become public, extensions like mq and rebase will
refuse to operate on them to prevent creating duplicate changesets.
Phases can also be manually manipulated with the \%\fBhg phase\fP\: command
if needed. See \%\fBhg help \-v phase\fP\: for examples.
.sp
To make your commits secret by default, put this in your
configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[phases]
new\-commit = secret
.ft P
.fi
.SS Phases and servers
.sp
Normally, all servers are \fBpublishing\fP by default. This means:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\- all draft changesets that are pulled or cloned appear in phase
public on the client

\- all draft changesets that are pushed appear as public on both
client and server

\- secret changesets are neither pushed, pulled, or cloned
.ft P
.fi
.IP Note
.
Pulling a draft changeset from a publishing server does not mark it
as public on the server side due to the read\-only nature of pull.
.RE
.sp
Sometimes it may be desirable to push and pull changesets in the draft
phase to share unfinished work. This can be done by setting a
repository to disable publishing in its configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[phases]
publish = False
.ft P
.fi
.sp
See \%\fBhg help config\fP\: for more information on configuration files.
.IP Note
.
Servers running older versions of Mercurial are treated as
publishing.
.RE
.IP Note
.
Changesets in secret phase are not exchanged with the server. This
applies to their content: file names, file contents, and changeset
metadata. For technical reasons, the identifier (e.g. d825e4025e39)
of the secret changeset may be communicated to the server.

.SH SPECIFYING REVISIONS
.sp
Mercurial supports several ways to specify revisions.
.SS Specifying single revisions
.sp
A plain integer is treated as a revision number. Negative integers are
treated as sequential offsets from the tip, with \-1 denoting the tip,
\-2 denoting the revision prior to the tip, and so forth.
.sp
A 40\-digit hexadecimal string is treated as a unique revision identifier.
A hexadecimal string less than 40 characters long is treated as a
unique revision identifier and is referred to as a short\-form
identifier. A short\-form identifier is only valid if it is the prefix
of exactly one full\-length identifier.
.sp
Any other string is treated as a bookmark, tag, or branch name. A
bookmark is a movable pointer to a revision. A tag is a permanent name
associated with a revision. A branch name denotes the tipmost open branch head
of that branch \- or if they are all closed, the tipmost closed head of the
branch. Bookmark, tag, and branch names must not contain the ":" character.
.sp
The reserved name "tip" always identifies the most recent revision.
.sp
The reserved name "null" indicates the null revision. This is the
revision of an empty repository, and the parent of revision 0.
.sp
The reserved name "." indicates the working directory parent. If no
working directory is checked out, it is equivalent to null. If an
uncommitted merge is in progress, "." is the revision of the first
parent.
.sp
Finally, commands that expect a single revision (like \fBhg update\fP) also
accept revsets (see below for details). When given a revset, they use the
last revision of the revset. A few commands accept two single revisions
(like \fBhg diff\fP). When given a revset, they use the first and the last
revisions of the revset.
.SS Specifying multiple revisions
.sp
Mercurial supports a functional language for selecting a set of
revisions. Expressions in this language are called revsets.
.sp
The language supports a number of predicates which are joined by infix
operators. Parenthesis can be used for grouping.
.sp
Identifiers such as branch names may need quoting with single or
double quotes if they contain characters like \fB\-\fP or if they match
one of the predefined predicates.
.sp
Special characters can be used in quoted identifiers by escaping them,
e.g., \fB\en\fP is interpreted as a newline. To prevent them from being
interpreted, strings can be prefixed with \fBr\fP, e.g. \fBr\(aq...\(aq\fP.
.SS Operators
.sp
There is a single prefix operator:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBnot x\fP
.sp
Changesets not in x. Short form is \fB! x\fP.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These are the supported infix operators:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBx::y\fP
.sp
A DAG range, meaning all changesets that are descendants of x and
ancestors of y, including x and y themselves. If the first endpoint
is left out, this is equivalent to \fBancestors(y)\fP, if the second
is left out it is equivalent to \fBdescendants(x)\fP.
.sp
An alternative syntax is \fBx..y\fP.
.TP
.B \fBx:y\fP
.sp
All changesets with revision numbers between x and y, both
inclusive. Either endpoint can be left out, they default to 0 and
tip.
.TP
.B \fBx and y\fP
.sp
The intersection of changesets in x and y. Short form is \fBx & y\fP.
.TP
.B \fBx or y\fP
.sp
The union of changesets in x and y. There are two alternative short
forms: \fBx | y\fP and \fBx + y\fP.
.TP
.B \fBx \- y\fP
.sp
Changesets in x but not in y.
.TP
.B \fBx % y\fP
.sp
Changesets that are ancestors of x but not ancestors of y (i.e. ::x \- ::y).
This is shorthand notation for \fBonly(x, y)\fP (see below). The second
argument is optional and, if left out, is equivalent to \fBonly(x)\fP.
.TP
.B \fBx^n\fP
.sp
The nth parent of x, n == 0, 1, or 2.
For n == 0, x; for n == 1, the first parent of each changeset in x;
for n == 2, the second parent of changeset in x.
.TP
.B \fBx~n\fP
.sp
The nth first ancestor of x; \fBx~0\fP is x; \fBx~3\fP is \fBx^^^\fP.
For n < 0, the nth unambiguous descendent of x.
.TP
.B \fBx ## y\fP
.sp
Concatenate strings and identifiers into one string.
.sp
All other prefix, infix and postfix operators have lower priority than
\fB##\fP. For example, \fBa1 ## a2~2\fP is equivalent to \fB(a1 ## a2)~2\fP.
.sp
For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[revsetalias]
issue(a1) = grep(r\(aq\ebissue[ :]?\(aq ## a1 ## r\(aq\eb|\ebbug\e(\(aq ## a1 ## r\(aq\e)\(aq)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fBissue(1234)\fP is equivalent to
\fBgrep(r\(aq\ebissue[ :]?1234\eb|\ebbug\e(1234\e)\(aq)\fP
in this case. This matches against all of "issue 1234", "issue:1234",
"issue1234" and "bug(1234)".
.UNINDENT
.sp
There is a single postfix operator:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBx^\fP
.sp
Equivalent to \fBx^1\fP, the first parent of each changeset in x.
.UNINDENT
.SS Patterns
.sp
Where noted, predicates that perform string matching can accept a pattern
string. The pattern may be either a literal, or a regular expression. If the
pattern starts with \fBre:\fP, the remainder of the pattern is treated as a
regular expression. Otherwise, it is treated as a literal. To match a pattern
that actually starts with \fBre:\fP, use the prefix \fBliteral:\fP.
.sp
Matching is case\-sensitive, unless otherwise noted.  To perform a case\-
insensitive match on a case\-sensitive predicate, use a regular expression,
prefixed with \fB(?i)\fP.
.sp
For example, \fBtag(r\(aqre:(?i)release\(aq)\fP matches "release" or "RELEASE"
or "Release", etc.
.SS Predicates
.sp
The following predicates are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBadds(pattern)\fP
.sp
Changesets that add a file matching pattern.
.sp
The pattern without explicit kind like \fBglob:\fP is expected to be
relative to the current directory and match against a file or a
directory.
.TP

.sp
All changesets, the same as \fB0:tip\fP.
.TP
.B \fBancestor(*changeset)\fP
.sp

The other side of the merge, if currently in an unresolved merge.
.sp
"merge" here includes merge conflicts from e.g. \(aqhg rebase\(aq or \(aqhg graft\(aq.
.TP
.B \fBcontains(pattern)\fP
.sp
The revision\(aqs manifest contains a file matching pattern (but might not
modify it). See \%\fBhg help patterns\fP\: for information about file patterns.
.sp
The pattern without explicit kind like \fBglob:\fP is expected to be
relative to the current directory and match against a file exactly
for efficiency.
.TP

.sp
Changesets converted from the given identifier in the old repository if
present, or all converted changesets if no identifier is specified.

the specified generation.
.TP
.B \fBdestination([set])\fP

Abort if the revset doesn\(aqt expect given size.
size can either be an integer range or an integer.
.sp

2 is not between 3 and 5 inclusive.
.TP
.B \fBextra(label, [value])\fP
.sp

instead.
.sp
This predicate uses \fBglob:\fP as the default kind of pattern.
.TP
.B \fBfilelog(pattern)\fP
.sp
Changesets connected to the specified filelog.
.sp
For performance reasons, visits only revisions mentioned in the file\-level
filelog, rather than filtering through all changesets (much faster, but
doesn\(aqt include deletes or duplicate changes). For a slower, more accurate
result, use \fBfile()\fP.
.sp
The pattern without explicit kind like \fBglob:\fP is expected to be
relative to the current directory and match against a file exactly
for efficiency.
.TP
.B \fBfirst(set, [n])\fP
.sp
An alias for limit().
.TP
.B \fBfollow([file[, startrev]])\fP
.sp
An alias for \fB::.\fP (ancestors of the working directory\(aqs first parent).
If file pattern is specified, the histories of files matching given
pattern in the revision given by startrev are followed, including copies.
.TP
.B \fBfollowlines(file, fromline:toline[, startrev=., descend=False])\fP
.sp
Changesets modifying \fIfile\fP in line range (\(aqfromline\(aq, \(aqtoline\(aq).
.sp
Line range corresponds to \(aqfile\(aq content at \(aqstartrev\(aq and should hence be
consistent with file size. If startrev is not specified, working directory\(aqs
parent is used.
.sp
By default, ancestors of \(aqstartrev\(aq are returned. If \(aqdescend\(aq is True,
descendants of \(aqstartrev\(aq are returned though renames are (currently) not
followed in this direction.
.TP
.B \fBgrep(regex)\fP
.sp
Like \fBkeyword(string)\fP but accepts a regex. Use \fBgrep(r\(aq...\(aq)\fP
to ensure special escape characters are handled correctly. Unlike

.B \fBheads(set)\fP
.sp
Members of set with no children in set.
.TP

.sp
Revision non\-ambiguously specified by the given hex string prefix.
.TP
.B \fBkeyword(string)\fP
.sp
Search commit message, user name, and names of changed files for
string. The match is case\-insensitive.
.sp
For a regular expression or case sensitive search of these fields, use
\fBgrep(regex)\fP.
.TP
.B \fBlast(set, [n])\fP
.sp
Last n members of set, defaulting to 1.
.TP
.B \fBlimit(set[, n[, offset]])\fP
.sp
First n members of set, defaulting to 1, starting from offset.
.TP
.B \fBmatching(revision [, field])\fP
.sp
Changesets in which a given set of fields match the set of fields in the
selected revision or set.
.sp
To match more than one field pass the list of fields to match separated
by spaces (e.g. \fBauthor description\fP).
.sp
Valid fields are most regular revision fields and some special fields.
.sp
Regular revision fields are \fBdescription\fP, \fBauthor\fP, \fBbranch\fP,
\fBdate\fP, \fBfiles\fP, \fBphase\fP, \fBparents\fP, \fBsubstate\fP, \fBuser\fP
and \fBdiff\fP.
Note that \fBauthor\fP and \fBuser\fP are synonyms. \fBdiff\fP refers to the
contents of the revision. Two revisions matching their \fBdiff\fP will
also match their \fBfiles\fP.
.sp
Special fields are \fBsummary\fP and \fBmetadata\fP:
\fBsummary\fP matches the first line of the description.
\fBmetadata\fP is equivalent to matching \fBdescription user date\fP
(i.e. it matches the main metadata fields).
.sp
\fBmetadata\fP is the default field which is used when no fields are
specified. You can match more than one field at a time.
.TP
.B \fBmax(set)\fP
.sp
Changeset with highest revision number in set.
.TP

.sp
The pattern without explicit kind like \fBglob:\fP is expected to be
relative to the current directory and match against a file or a
directory.

.sp
Pattern matching is supported for \fInamespace\fP. See
\%\fBhg help revisions.patterns\fP\:.
.TP
.B \fBnodefromfile(path)\fP
.sp
Read a list of nodes from the file at \fIpath\fP.
.sp
This applies \fIid(LINE)\fP to each line of the file.

This is useful when the amount of nodes you need to specify gets too large
for the command line.
.TP
.B \fBnone()\fP
.sp
No changesets.
.TP
.B \fBonly(set, [set])\fP
.sp
Changesets that are ancestors of the first set that are not ancestors
of any other head in the repo. If a second set is specified, the result
is ancestors of the first set that are not ancestors of the second set
(i.e. ::<set1> \- ::<set2>).
.TP
.B \fBorigin([set])\fP
.sp
Changesets that were specified as a source for the grafts, transplants or
rebases that created the given revisions.  Omitting the optional set is the
same as passing all().  If a changeset created by these operations is itself
specified as a source for one of these operations, only the source changeset
for the first operation is selected.
.TP
.B \fBoutgoing([path])\fP
.sp
Changesets not found in the specified destination repository, or the
default push location.
.sp
If the location resolve to multiple repositories, the union of all
outgoing changeset will be used.
.TP
.B \fBp1([set])\fP
.sp
First parent of changesets in set, or the working directory.
.TP
.B \fBp2([set])\fP
.sp
Second parent of changesets in set, or the working directory.
.TP
.B \fBparents([set])\fP
.sp
The set of all parents for all changesets in set, or the working directory.
.TP
.B \fBpresent(set)\fP
.sp
An empty set, if any revision in set isn\(aqt found; otherwise,
all revisions in set.
.sp
If any of specified revisions is not present in the local repository,
the query is normally aborted. But this predicate allows the query
to continue even in such cases.
.TP
.B \fBpublic()\fP
.sp
Changeset in public phase.
.TP
.B \fBremote([id [,path]])\fP
.sp
Local revision that corresponds to the given identifier in a
remote repository, if present. Here, the \(aq.\(aq identifier is a
synonym for the current local branch.
.TP
.B \fBremoves(pattern)\fP
.sp
Changesets which remove files matching pattern.
.sp
The pattern without explicit kind like \fBglob:\fP is expected to be
relative to the current directory and match against a file or a
directory.
.TP
.B \fBrev(number)\fP
.sp
Revision with the given numeric identifier.
.TP
.B \fBreverse(set)\fP
.sp
Reverse order of set.
.TP
.B \fBrevset(set)\fP
.sp
Strictly interpret the content as a revset.
.sp
The content of this special predicate will be strictly interpreted as a
revset. For example, \fBrevset(id(0))\fP will be interpreted as "id(0)"
without possible ambiguity with a "id(0)" bookmark or tag.
.TP
.B \fBroots(set)\fP
.sp
Changesets in set with no parent changeset in set.
.TP
.B \fBsecret()\fP

.TP
.B \fBsort(set[, [\-]key... [, ...]])\fP
.sp
Sort set by keys. The default sort order is ascending, specify a key
as \fB\-key\fP to sort in descending order.
.sp
The keys can be:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBrev\fP for the revision number,
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBbranch\fP for the branch name,
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBdesc\fP for the commit message (description),
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBuser\fP for user name (\fBauthor\fP can be used as an alias),
.IP \(bu 2

\fBtopo\fP for a reverse topographical sort
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBnode\fP the nodeid of the revision
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBrandom\fP randomly shuffle revisions
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fBtopo\fP sort order cannot be combined with other sort keys. This sort
takes one optional argument, \fBtopo.firstbranch\fP, which takes a revset that
specifies what topographical branches to prioritize in the sort.
.sp
The \fBrandom\fP sort takes one optional \fBrandom.seed\fP argument to control
the pseudo\-randomness of the result.
.TP
.B \fBsubrepo([pattern])\fP

.SS Aliases
.sp
New predicates (known as "aliases") can be defined, using any combination of
existing predicates or other aliases. An alias definition looks like:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<alias> = <definition>
.ft P
.fi
.sp
in the \fBrevsetalias\fP section of a Mercurial configuration file. Arguments
of the form \fIa1\fP, \fIa2\fP, etc. are substituted from the alias into the
definition.
.sp
For example,
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[revsetalias]
h = heads()
d(s) = sort(s, date)
rs(s, k) = reverse(sort(s, k))
.ft P
.fi
.sp
defines three aliases, \fBh\fP, \fBd\fP, and \fBrs\fP. \fBrs(0:tip, author)\fP is
exactly equivalent to \fBreverse(sort(0:tip, author))\fP.
.SS Equivalents
.sp
Command line equivalents for \%\fBhg log\fP\::

.SH RUST IN MERCURIAL
.sp
Mercurial can be augmented with Rust extensions for speeding up certain
operations.
.SS Compatibility
.sp
Though the Rust extensions are only tested by the project under Linux, users of
MacOS, FreeBSD and other UNIX\-likes have been using the Rust extensions. Your
mileage may vary, but by all means do give us feedback or signal your interest
for better support.
.sp
No Rust extensions are available for Windows at this time.

.sp
More features are in the works, and improvements on the above listed are still

.SS Checking for Rust
.sp
You may already have the Rust extensions depending on how you install
Mercurial:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hg debuginstall | grep \-i rust
checking Rust extensions (installed)
checking module policy (rust+c\-allow)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If those lines don\(aqt even exist, you\(aqre using an old version of \fIhg\fP which does
not have any Rust extensions yet.
.SS Installing
.sp
You will need \fIcargo\fP to be in your \fI$PATH\fP. See the "MSRV" section for which
version to use.
.SS Using pip
.sp
Users of \fIpip\fP can install the Rust extensions with the following command:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ pip install mercurial \-\-global\-option \-\-rust \-\-no\-use\-pep517
.ft P
.fi
.sp
\fI\-\-no\-use\-pep517\fP is here to tell \fIpip\fP to preserve backwards compatibility with
the legacy \fIsetup.py\fP system. Mercurial has not yet migrated its complex setup
to the new system, so we still need this to add compiled extensions.
.sp
This might take a couple of minutes because you\(aqre compiling everything.
.sp
See the "Checking for Rust" section to see if the install succeeded.
.SS From your distribution
.sp
Some distributions are shipping Mercurial with Rust extensions enabled and
pre\-compiled (meaning you won\(aqt have to install \fIcargo\fP), or allow you to
specify an install flag. Check with your specific distribution for how to do
that, or ask their team to add support for hg+Rust!
.SS From source
.sp
Please refer to the \fIrust/README.rst\fP file in the Mercurial repository for
instructions on how to install from source.
.SS MSRV
.sp
The minimum supported Rust version is defined in \fIrust/clippy.toml\fP.
The project\(aqs policy is to keep it at or below the version from Debian testing,
to make the distributions\(aq job easier.
.SS rhg
.sp
There exists an experimental pure\-Rust version of Mercurial called \fIrhg\fP with a
fallback mechanism for unsupported invocations. It allows for much faster
execution of certain commands while adding no discernable overhead for the rest.
.sp
The only way of trying it out is by building it from source. Please refer to
\fIrust/README.rst\fP in the Mercurial repository.

.SH USING MERCURIAL FROM SCRIPTS AND AUTOMATION
.sp
It is common for machines (as opposed to humans) to consume Mercurial.
This help topic describes some of the considerations for interfacing
machines with Mercurial.
.SS Choosing an Interface
.sp
Machines have a choice of several methods to interface with Mercurial.
These include:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
Executing the \fBhg\fP process
.IP \(bu 2
.
Querying a HTTP server
.IP \(bu 2
.
Calling out to a command server
.UNINDENT
.sp
Executing \fBhg\fP processes is very similar to how humans interact with
Mercurial in the shell. It should already be familiar to you.
.sp
\%\fBhg serve\fP\: can be used to start a server. By default, this will start
a "hgweb" HTTP server. This HTTP server has support for machine\-readable
output, such as JSON. For more, see \%\fBhg help hgweb\fP\:.
.sp
\%\fBhg serve\fP\: can also start a "command server." Clients can connect
to this server and issue Mercurial commands over a special protocol.
For more details on the command server, including links to client
libraries, see \%https://www.mercurial\-scm.org/wiki/CommandServer\:.
.sp
\%\fBhg serve\fP\: based interfaces (the hgweb and command servers) have the
advantage over simple \fBhg\fP process invocations in that they are
likely more efficient. This is because there is significant overhead
to spawn new Python processes.
.IP Tip
.
If you need to invoke several \fBhg\fP processes in short order and/or
performance is important to you, use of a server\-based interface
is highly recommended.
.RE
.SS Environment Variables
.sp
As documented in \%\fBhg help environment\fP\:, various environment variables
influence the operation of Mercurial. The following are particularly
relevant for machines consuming Mercurial:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B HGPLAIN
.
If not set, Mercurial\(aqs output could be influenced by configuration
settings that impact its encoding, verbose mode, localization, etc.
.sp
It is highly recommended for machines to set this variable when
invoking \fBhg\fP processes.
.TP
.B HGENCODING
.
If not set, the locale used by Mercurial will be detected from the
environment. If the determined locale does not support display of
certain characters, Mercurial may render these character sequences
incorrectly (often by using "?" as a placeholder for invalid
characters in the current locale).
.sp
Explicitly setting this environment variable is a good practice to
guarantee consistent results. "utf\-8" is a good choice on UNIX\-like
environments.
.TP
.B HGRCPATH
.
If not set, Mercurial will inherit config options from config files
using the process described in \%\fBhg help config\fP\:. This includes
inheriting user or system\-wide config files.
.sp
When utmost control over the Mercurial configuration is desired, the
value of \fBHGRCPATH\fP can be set to an explicit file with known good
configs. In rare cases, the value can be set to an empty file or the
null device (often \fB/dev/null\fP) to bypass loading of any user or
system config files. Note that these approaches can have unintended
consequences, as the user and system config files often define things
like the username and extensions that may be required to interface
with a repository.
.TP
.B HGRCSKIPREPO
.
When set, the .hg/hgrc from repositories are not read.
.sp
Note that not reading the repository\(aqs configuration can have
unintended consequences, as the repository config files can define
things like extensions that are required for access to the
repository.
.UNINDENT
.SS Command\-line Flags
.sp
Mercurial\(aqs default command\-line parser is designed for humans, and is not
robust against malicious input. For instance, you can start a debugger by
passing \fB\-\-debugger\fP as an option value:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ REV=\-\-debugger sh \-c \(aqhg log \-r "$REV"\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This happens because several command\-line flags need to be scanned without
using a concrete command table, which may be modified while loading repository
settings and extensions.
.sp
Since Mercurial 4.4.2, the parsing of such flags may be restricted by setting
\fBHGPLAIN=+strictflags\fP. When this feature is enabled, all early options
(e.g. \fB\-R/\-\-repository\fP, \fB\-\-cwd\fP, \fB\-\-config\fP) must be specified first
amongst the other global options, and cannot be injected to an arbitrary
location:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ HGPLAIN=+strictflags hg \-R "$REPO" log \-r "$REV"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In earlier Mercurial versions where \fB+strictflags\fP isn\(aqt available, you
can mitigate the issue by concatenating an option value with its flag:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hg log \-r"$REV" \-\-keyword="$KEYWORD"
.ft P
.fi
.SS Consuming Command Output
.sp
It is common for machines to need to parse the output of Mercurial
commands for relevant data. This section describes the various
techniques for doing so.
.SS Parsing Raw Command Output
.sp
Likely the simplest and most effective solution for consuming command
output is to simply invoke \fBhg\fP commands as you would as a user and
parse their output.
.sp
The output of many commands can easily be parsed with tools like
\fBgrep\fP, \fBsed\fP, and \fBawk\fP.
.sp
A potential downside with parsing command output is that the output
of commands can change when Mercurial is upgraded. While Mercurial
does generally strive for strong backwards compatibility, command
output does occasionally change. Having tests for your automated
interactions with \fBhg\fP commands is generally recommended, but is
even more important when raw command output parsing is involved.
.SS Using Templates to Control Output
.sp
Many \fBhg\fP commands support templatized output via the
\fB\-T/\-\-template\fP argument. For more, see \%\fBhg help templates\fP\:.
.sp
Templates are useful for explicitly controlling output so that
you get exactly the data you want formatted how you want it. For
example, \fBlog \-T {node}\en\fP can be used to print a newline
delimited list of changeset nodes instead of a human\-tailored
output containing authors, dates, descriptions, etc.
.IP Tip
.
If parsing raw command output is too complicated, consider
using templates to make your life easier.
.RE
.sp
The \fB\-T/\-\-template\fP argument allows specifying pre\-defined styles.
Mercurial ships with the machine\-readable styles \fBcbor\fP, \fBjson\fP,
and \fBxml\fP, which provide CBOR, JSON, and XML output, respectively.
These are useful for producing output that is machine readable as\-is.
.sp
(Mercurial 5.0 is required for CBOR style.)
.IP Important
.
The \fBjson\fP and \fBxml\fP styles are considered experimental. While
they may be attractive to use for easily obtaining machine\-readable
output, their behavior may change in subsequent versions.
.sp
These styles may also exhibit unexpected results when dealing with
certain encodings. Mercurial treats things like filenames as a
series of bytes and normalizing certain byte sequences to JSON
or XML with certain encoding settings can lead to surprises.
.RE
.SS Command Server Output
.sp
If using the command server to interact with Mercurial, you are likely
using an existing library/API that abstracts implementation details of
the command server. If so, this interface layer may perform parsing for
you, saving you the work of implementing it yourself.
.SS Output Verbosity
.sp
Commands often have varying output verbosity, even when machine
readable styles are being used (e.g. \fB\-T json\fP). Adding
\fB\-v/\-\-verbose\fP and \fB\-\-debug\fP to the command\(aqs arguments can
increase the amount of data exposed by Mercurial.
.sp
An alternate way to get the data you need is by explicitly specifying
a template.
.SS Other Topics
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B revsets
.
Revisions sets is a functional query language for selecting a set
of revisions. Think of it as SQL for Mercurial repositories. Revsets
are useful for querying repositories for specific data.
.sp
See \%\fBhg help revsets\fP\: for more.
.TP
.B share extension
.
The \fBshare\fP extension provides functionality for sharing
repository data across several working copies. It can even
automatically "pool" storage for logically related repositories when
cloning.
.sp
Configuring the \fBshare\fP extension can lead to significant resource
utilization reduction, particularly around disk space and the
network. This is especially true for continuous integration (CI)
environments.
.sp
See \%\fBhg help \-e share\fP\: for more.
.UNINDENT
.SH SUBREPOSITORIES
.sp
Subrepositories let you nest external repositories or projects into a
parent Mercurial repository, and make commands operate on them as a
group.
.sp
Mercurial currently supports Mercurial, Git, and Subversion
subrepositories.
.sp
Subrepositories are made of three components:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
.
Nested repository checkouts. They can appear anywhere in the
parent working directory.
.IP 2. 3
.
Nested repository references. They are defined in \fB.hgsub\fP, which
should be placed in the root of working directory, and
tell where the subrepository checkouts come from. Mercurial
subrepositories are referenced like:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
path/to/nested = https://example.com/nested/repo/path
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Git and Subversion subrepos are also supported:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
path/to/nested = [git]git://example.com/nested/repo/path
path/to/nested = [svn]https://example.com/nested/trunk/path
.ft P
.fi
.sp
where \fBpath/to/nested\fP is the checkout location relatively to the
parent Mercurial root, and \fBhttps://example.com/nested/repo/path\fP
is the source repository path. The source can also reference a
filesystem path.
.sp
Note that \fB.hgsub\fP does not exist by default in Mercurial
repositories, you have to create and add it to the parent
repository before using subrepositories.
.IP 3. 3
.
Nested repository states. They are defined in \fB.hgsubstate\fP, which
is placed in the root of working directory, and
capture whatever information is required to restore the
subrepositories to the state they were committed in a parent
repository changeset. Mercurial automatically record the nested
repositories states when committing in the parent repository.
.IP Note
.
The \fB.hgsubstate\fP file should not be edited manually.
.RE
.UNINDENT
.SS Adding a Subrepository
.sp
If \fB.hgsub\fP does not exist, create it and add it to the parent
repository. Clone or checkout the external projects where you want it
to live in the parent repository. Edit \fB.hgsub\fP and add the
subrepository entry as described above. At this point, the
subrepository is tracked and the next commit will record its state in
\fB.hgsubstate\fP and bind it to the committed changeset.
.SS Synchronizing a Subrepository
.sp
Subrepos do not automatically track the latest changeset of their
sources. Instead, they are updated to the changeset that corresponds
with the changeset checked out in the top\-level changeset. This is so
developers always get a consistent set of compatible code and
libraries when they update.
.sp
Thus, updating subrepos is a manual process. Simply check out target
subrepo at the desired revision, test in the top\-level repo, then
commit in the parent repository to record the new combination.
.SS Deleting a Subrepository
.sp
To remove a subrepository from the parent repository, delete its
reference from \fB.hgsub\fP, then remove its files.
.SS Interaction with Mercurial Commands
.INDENT 0.0

Subversion subrepositories are currently silently
ignored.
.TP
.B addremove
.
addremove does not recurse into subrepos unless
\-S/\-\-subrepos is specified.  However, if you specify the full
path of a directory in a subrepo, addremove will be performed on
it even without \-S/\-\-subrepos being specified.  Git and
Subversion subrepositories will print a warning and continue.
.TP
.B archive
.
archive does not recurse in subrepositories unless
\-S/\-\-subrepos is specified.
.TP
.B cat
.
Git subrepositories only support exact file matches.
Subversion subrepositories are currently ignored.
.TP
.B commit
.
commit creates a consistent snapshot of the state of the
entire project and its subrepositories. If any subrepositories
have been modified, Mercurial will abort.  Mercurial can be made
to instead commit all modified subrepositories by specifying
\-S/\-\-subrepos, or setting "ui.commitsubrepos=True" in a
configuration file (see \%\fBhg help config\fP\:).  After there are no
longer any modified subrepositories, it records their state and
finally commits it in the parent repository.  The \-\-addremove
option also honors the \-S/\-\-subrepos option.  However, Git and
Subversion subrepositories will print a warning and abort.
.TP
.B diff
.
diff does not recurse in subrepos unless \-S/\-\-subrepos is
specified.  However, if you specify the full path of a file or
directory in a subrepo, it will be diffed even without
\-S/\-\-subrepos being specified.  Subversion subrepositories are
currently silently ignored.
.TP
.B files
.
files does not recurse into subrepos unless \-S/\-\-subrepos is
specified.  However, if you specify the full path of a file or
directory in a subrepo, it will be displayed even without
\-S/\-\-subrepos being specified.  Git and Subversion subrepositories
are currently silently ignored.
.TP
.B forget
.
forget currently only handles exact file matches in subrepos.
Git and Subversion subrepositories are currently silently ignored.
.TP
.B incoming
.
incoming does not recurse in subrepos unless \-S/\-\-subrepos
is specified. Git and Subversion subrepositories are currently
silently ignored.
.TP
.B outgoing
.
outgoing does not recurse in subrepos unless \-S/\-\-subrepos
is specified. Git and Subversion subrepositories are currently
silently ignored.
.TP
.B pull
.
pull is not recursive since it is not clear what to pull prior
to running \%\fBhg update\fP\:. Listing and retrieving all
subrepositories changes referenced by the parent repository pulled
changesets is expensive at best, impossible in the Subversion
case.
.TP
.B push
.
Mercurial will automatically push all subrepositories first
when the parent repository is being pushed. This ensures new
subrepository changes are available when referenced by top\-level
repositories.  Push is a no\-op for Subversion subrepositories.
.TP
.B serve
.
serve does not recurse into subrepositories unless
\-S/\-\-subrepos is specified.  Git and Subversion subrepositories
are currently silently ignored.
.TP
.B status
.
status does not recurse into subrepositories unless
\-S/\-\-subrepos is specified. Subrepository changes are displayed as
regular Mercurial changes on the subrepository
elements. Subversion subrepositories are currently silently
ignored.
.TP
.B remove
.
remove does not recurse into subrepositories unless
\-S/\-\-subrepos is specified.  However, if you specify a file or
directory path in a subrepo, it will be removed even without
\-S/\-\-subrepos.  Git and Subversion subrepositories are currently
silently ignored.
.TP
.B update
.
update restores the subrepos in the state they were
originally committed in target changeset. If the recorded
changeset is not available in the current subrepository, Mercurial
will pull it in first before updating.  This means that updating
can require network access when using subrepositories.
.UNINDENT
.SS Remapping Subrepositories Sources
.sp
A subrepository source location may change during a project life,
invalidating references stored in the parent repository history. To
fix this, rewriting rules can be defined in parent repository \fBhgrc\fP
file or in Mercurial configuration. See the \fB[subpaths]\fP section in
hgrc(5) for more details.
.SH TEMPLATE USAGE
.sp
Mercurial allows you to customize output of commands through
templates. You can either pass in a template or select an existing
template\-style from the command line, via the \-\-template option.
.sp
You can customize output for any "log\-like" command: log,
outgoing, incoming, tip, parents, and heads.
.sp
Some built\-in styles are packaged with Mercurial. These can be listed
with \%\fBhg log \-\-template list\fP\:. Example usage:
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.sp
A template is a piece of text, with markup to invoke variable
expansion:

.UNINDENT
.sp
The "date" keyword does not produce human\-readable output. If you
want to use a date in your output, you can use a filter to process
it. Filters are functions which return a string based on the input
variable. Be sure to use the stringify filter first when you\(aqre
applying a string\-input filter to a list\-like input variable.
You can also use a chain of filters to get the desired output:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hg tip \-\-template "{date|isodate}\en"
2008\-08\-21 18:22 +0000

.SS Operators
.sp
We provide a limited set of infix arithmetic operations on integers:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
+ for addition
\- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for floor division (division rounded to integer nearest \-infinity)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Division fulfills the law x = x / y + mod(x, y).
.sp
Also, for any expression that returns a list, there is a list operator:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
expr % "{template}"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
As seen in the above example, \fB{template}\fP is interpreted as a template.
To prevent it from being interpreted, you can use an escape character \fB\e{\fP
or a raw string prefix, \fBr\(aq...\(aq\fP.
.sp
The dot operator can be used as a shorthand for accessing a sub item:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBexpr.member\fP is roughly equivalent to \fBexpr % \(aq{member}\(aq\fP if \fBexpr\fP
returns a non\-list/dict. The returned value is not stringified.
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBdict.key\fP is identical to \fBget(dict, \(aqkey\(aq)\fP.
.UNINDENT
.SS Aliases
.sp
New keywords and functions can be defined in the \fBtemplatealias\fP section of
a Mercurial configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
<alias> = <definition>
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Arguments of the form \fIa1\fP, \fIa2\fP, etc. are substituted from the alias into
the definition.
.sp
For example,
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[templatealias]
r = rev
rn = "{r}:{node|short}"
leftpad(s, w) = pad(s, w, \(aq \(aq, True)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
defines two symbol aliases, \fBr\fP and \fBrn\fP, and a function alias
\fBleftpad()\fP.
.sp
It\(aqs also possible to specify complete template strings, using the
\fBtemplates\fP section. The syntax used is the general template string syntax.
.sp
For example,
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[templates]
nodedate = "{node|short}: {date(date, "%Y\-%m\-%d")}\en"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
defines a template, \fBnodedate\fP, which can be called like:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hg log \-r . \-Tnodedate
.ft P
.fi
.sp
A template defined in \fBtemplates\fP section can also be referenced from
another template:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hg log \-r . \-T "{rev} {nodedate}"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
but be aware that the keywords cannot be overridden by templates. For example,
a template defined as \fBtemplates.rev\fP cannot be referenced as \fB{rev}\fP.
.sp
A template defined in \fBtemplates\fP section may have sub templates which
are inserted before/after/between items:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[templates]
myjson = \(aq {dict(rev, node|short)|json}\(aq
myjson:docheader = \(aq\e{\en\(aq
myjson:docfooter = \(aq\en}\en\(aq
myjson:separator = \(aq,\en\(aq

.sp
Valid URLs are of the form:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
local/filesystem/path[#revision]
file://local/filesystem/path[#revision]
http://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
https://[user[:pass]@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
ssh://[user@]host[:port]/[path][#revision]
path://pathname
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Paths in the local filesystem can either point to Mercurial
repositories or to bundle files (as created by \%\fBhg bundle\fP\: or
\%\fBhg incoming \-\-bundle\fP\:). See also \%\fBhg help paths\fP\:.
.sp
An optional identifier after # indicates a particular branch, tag, or
changeset to use from the remote repository. See also \%\fBhg help
revisions\fP\:.
.sp
Some features, such as pushing to \%http://\: and \%https://\: URLs are only
possible if the feature is explicitly enabled on the remote Mercurial
server.
.sp
Note that the security of HTTPS URLs depends on proper configuration of
web.cacerts.
.sp
Some notes about using SSH with Mercurial:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
SSH requires an accessible shell account on the destination machine
and a copy of hg in the remote path or specified with remotecmd.
.IP \(bu 2
.
path is relative to the remote user\(aqs home directory by default. Use
an extra slash at the start of a path to specify an absolute path:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ssh://example.com//tmp/repository
.ft P
.fi
.IP \(bu 2
.
Mercurial doesn\(aqt use its own compression via SSH; the right thing
to do is to configure it in your ~/.ssh/config, e.g.:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Host *.mylocalnetwork.example.com
  Compression no
Host *
  Compression yes
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Alternatively specify "ssh \-C" as your ssh command in your
configuration file or with the \-\-ssh command line option.
.UNINDENT
.sp
These URLs can all be stored in your configuration file with path
aliases under the [paths] section like so:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[paths]
alias1 = URL1
alias2 = URL2
\&...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can then use the alias for any command that uses a URL (for
example \%\fBhg pull alias1\fP\: will be treated as \%\fBhg pull URL1\fP\:).
.sp
Two path aliases are special because they are used as defaults when
you do not provide the URL to a command:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B default:
.
When you create a repository with hg clone, the clone command saves
the location of the source repository as the new repository\(aqs

.sp
incorporate corrections into the stack of draft changesets:
.sp

.ft C
hg absorb [OPTION] [FILE]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
absorb analyzes each change in your working directory and attempts to
amend the changed lines into the changesets in your stack that first
introduced those lines.
.sp
If absorb cannot find an unambiguous changeset to amend for a change,
that change will be left in the working directory, untouched. They can be
observed by \%\fBhg status\fP\: or \%\fBhg diff\fP\: afterwards. In other words,
absorb does not write to the working directory.
.sp
Changesets outside the revset \fI::. and not public() and not merge()\fP will
not be changed.
.sp
Changesets that become empty after applying the changes will be deleted.
.sp
By default, absorb will show what it plans to do and prompt for
confirmation.  If you are confident that the changes will be absorbed
to the correct place, run \%\fBhg absorb \-a\fP\: to apply the changes
immediately.

.SS acl
.sp
hooks for controlling repository access
.sp
This hook makes it possible to allow or deny write access to given
branches and paths of a repository when receiving incoming changesets
via pretxnchangegroup and pretxncommit.
.sp
The authorization is matched based on the local user name on the
system where the hook runs, and not the committer of the original
changeset (since the latter is merely informative).
.sp
The acl hook is best used along with a restricted shell like hgsh,
preventing authenticating users from doing anything other than pushing
or pulling. The hook is not safe to use if users have interactive
shell access, as they can then disable the hook. Nor is it safe if
remote users share an account, because then there is no way to
distinguish them.
.sp
The order in which access checks are performed is:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
.
Deny  list for branches (section \fBacl.deny.branches\fP)
.IP 2. 3
.
Allow list for branches (section \fBacl.allow.branches\fP)
.IP 3. 3
.
Deny  list for paths    (section \fBacl.deny\fP)
.IP 4. 3
.
Allow list for paths    (section \fBacl.allow\fP)
.UNINDENT
.sp
The allow and deny sections take key\-value pairs.
.SS Branch\-based Access Control
.sp
Use the \fBacl.deny.branches\fP and \fBacl.allow.branches\fP sections to
have branch\-based access control. Keys in these sections can be
either:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
a branch name, or
.IP \(bu 2
.
an asterisk, to match any branch;
.UNINDENT
.sp
The corresponding values can be either:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
a comma\-separated list containing users and groups, or
.IP \(bu 2
.
an asterisk, to match anyone;
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can add the "!" prefix to a user or group name to invert the sense
of the match.
.SS Path\-based Access Control
.sp
Use the \fBacl.deny\fP and \fBacl.allow\fP sections to have path\-based
access control. Keys in these sections accept a subtree pattern (with
a glob syntax by default). The corresponding values follow the same
syntax as the other sections above.
.SS Bookmark\-based Access Control
.sp
Use the \fBacl.deny.bookmarks\fP and \fBacl.allow.bookmarks\fP sections to
have bookmark\-based access control. Keys in these sections can be
either:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
a bookmark name, or
.IP \(bu 2
.
an asterisk, to match any bookmark;
.UNINDENT
.sp
The corresponding values can be either:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
a comma\-separated list containing users and groups, or
.IP \(bu 2
.
an asterisk, to match anyone;
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can add the "!" prefix to a user or group name to invert the sense
of the match.
.sp
Note: for interactions between clients and servers using Mercurial 3.6+
a rejection will generally reject the entire push, for interactions
involving older clients, the commit transactions will already be accepted,
and only the bookmark movement will be rejected.
.SS Groups
.sp
Group names must be prefixed with an \fB@\fP symbol. Specifying a group
name has the same effect as specifying all the users in that group.
.sp
You can define group members in the \fBacl.groups\fP section.
If a group name is not defined there, and Mercurial is running under
a Unix\-like system, the list of users will be taken from the OS.
Otherwise, an exception will be raised.

.SS Examples using the "!" prefix
.sp
Suppose there\(aqs a branch that only a given user (or group) should be able to
push to, and you don\(aqt want to restrict access to any other branch that may
be created.
.sp
The "!" prefix allows you to prevent anyone except a given user or group to
push changesets in a given branch or path.
.sp
In the examples below, we will:
1) Deny access to branch "ring" to anyone but user "gollum"
2) Deny access to branch "lake" to anyone but members of the group "hobbit"
3) Deny access to a file to anyone but user "gollum"

.SS bugzilla
.sp
hooks for integrating with the Bugzilla bug tracker
.sp
This hook extension adds comments on bugs in Bugzilla when changesets
that refer to bugs by Bugzilla ID are seen. The comment is formatted using
the Mercurial template mechanism.
.sp
The bug references can optionally include an update for Bugzilla of the
hours spent working on the bug. Bugs can also be marked fixed.
.sp
Four basic modes of access to Bugzilla are provided:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
.
Access via the Bugzilla REST\-API. Requires bugzilla 5.0 or later.
.IP 2. 3
.
Access via the Bugzilla XMLRPC interface. Requires Bugzilla 3.4 or later.
.IP 3. 3
.
Check data via the Bugzilla XMLRPC interface and submit bug change
via email to Bugzilla email interface. Requires Bugzilla 3.4 or later.
.IP 4. 3
.
Writing directly to the Bugzilla database. Only Bugzilla installations
using MySQL are supported. Requires Python MySQLdb.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Writing directly to the database is susceptible to schema changes, and
relies on a Bugzilla contrib script to send out bug change
notification emails. This script runs as the user running Mercurial,
must be run on the host with the Bugzilla install, and requires
permission to read Bugzilla configuration details and the necessary
MySQL user and password to have full access rights to the Bugzilla
database. For these reasons this access mode is now considered
deprecated, and will not be updated for new Bugzilla versions going
forward. Only adding comments is supported in this access mode.
.sp
Access via XMLRPC needs a Bugzilla username and password to be specified
in the configuration. Comments are added under that username. Since the
configuration must be readable by all Mercurial users, it is recommended
that the rights of that user are restricted in Bugzilla to the minimum
necessary to add comments. Marking bugs fixed requires Bugzilla 4.0 and later.
.sp
Access via XMLRPC/email uses XMLRPC to query Bugzilla, but sends
email to the Bugzilla email interface to submit comments to bugs.
The From: address in the email is set to the email address of the Mercurial
user, so the comment appears to come from the Mercurial user. In the event
that the Mercurial user email is not recognized by Bugzilla as a Bugzilla
user, the email associated with the Bugzilla username used to log into
Bugzilla is used instead as the source of the comment. Marking bugs fixed
works on all supported Bugzilla versions.
.sp
Access via the REST\-API needs either a Bugzilla username and password
or an apikey specified in the configuration. Comments are made under
the given username or the user associated with the apikey in Bugzilla.
.sp
Configuration items common to all access modes:
.INDENT 0.0

\fBhours\fP, e.g. \fBhours 1.5\fP. Matching is case insensitive.
.TP
.B bugzilla.fixregexp
.
Regular expression to match bug IDs for marking fixed in changeset
commit message. This must contain a "()" named group \fB<ids>\(ga containing
the bug IDs separated by non\-digit characters. It may also contain
a named group \(ga\(ga<hours>\fP with a floating\-point number giving the

.SS censor
.sp
erase file content at a given revision
.sp
The censor command instructs Mercurial to erase all content of a file at a given
revision \fIwithout updating the changeset hash.\fP This allows existing history to
remain valid while preventing future clones/pulls from receiving the erased
data.
.sp
Typical uses for censor are due to security or legal requirements, including:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
* Passwords, private keys, cryptographic material
* Licensed data/code/libraries for which the license has expired
* Personally Identifiable Information or other private data
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Censored nodes can interrupt mercurial\(aqs typical operation whenever the excised
data needs to be materialized. Some commands, like \fBhg cat\fP/\fBhg revert\fP,
simply fail when asked to produce censored data. Others, like \fBhg verify\fP and
\fBhg update\fP, must be capable of tolerating censored data to continue to
function in a meaningful way. Such commands only tolerate censored file
As having a censored version in a checkout is impractical. The current head
revisions of the repository are checked. If the revision to be censored is in
any of them the command will abort.
.sp
A few informative commands such as \fBhg grep\fP will unconditionally
ignore censored data and merely report that it was encountered.

.SS clonebundles
.sp
advertise pre\-generated bundles to seed clones
.sp
"clonebundles" is a server\-side extension used to advertise the existence
of pre\-generated, externally hosted bundle files to clients that are
cloning so that cloning can be faster, more reliable, and require less
resources on the server. "pullbundles" is a related feature for sending
pre\-generated bundle files to clients as part of pull operations.
.sp
Cloning can be a CPU and I/O intensive operation on servers. Traditionally,
the server, in response to a client\(aqs request to clone, dynamically generates
a bundle containing the entire repository content and sends it to the client.
There is no caching on the server and the server will have to redundantly
generate the same outgoing bundle in response to each clone request. For
servers with large repositories or with high clone volume, the load from
clones can make scaling the server challenging and costly.
.sp
This extension provides server operators the ability to offload
potentially expensive clone load to an external service. Pre\-generated
bundles also allow using more CPU intensive compression, reducing the
effective bandwidth requirements.
.sp
Here\(aqs how clone bundles work:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
.
A server operator establishes a mechanism for making bundle files available
on a hosting service where Mercurial clients can fetch them.
.IP 2. 3
.
A manifest file listing available bundle URLs and some optional metadata
is added to the Mercurial repository on the server.
.IP 3. 3
.
A client initiates a clone against a clone bundles aware server.
.IP 4. 3
.
The client sees the server is advertising clone bundles and fetches the
manifest listing available bundles.
.IP 5. 3
.
The client filters and sorts the available bundles based on what it
supports and prefers.
.IP 6. 3
.
The client downloads and applies an available bundle from the
server\-specified URL.
.IP 7. 3
.
The client reconnects to the original server and performs the equivalent
of \%\fBhg pull\fP\: to retrieve all repository data not in the bundle. (The
repository could have been updated between when the bundle was created
and when the client started the clone.) This may use "pullbundles".
.UNINDENT
.sp
Instead of the server generating full repository bundles for every clone
request, it generates full bundles once and they are subsequently reused to
bootstrap new clones. The server may still transfer data at clone time.
However, this is only data that has been added/changed since the bundle was
created. For large, established repositories, this can reduce server load for
clones to less than 1% of original.
.sp
Here\(aqs how pullbundles work:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
.
A manifest file listing available bundles and describing the revisions
is added to the Mercurial repository on the server.
.IP 2. 3
.
A new\-enough client informs the server that it supports partial pulls
and initiates a pull.
.IP 3. 3
.
If the server has pull bundles enabled and sees the client advertising
partial pulls, it checks for a matching pull bundle in the manifest.
A bundle matches if the format is supported by the client, the client
has the required revisions already and needs something from the bundle.
.IP 4. 3
.
If there is at least one matching bundle, the server sends it to the client.
.IP 5. 3
.
The client applies the bundle and notices that the server reply was
incomplete. It initiates another pull.
.UNINDENT
.sp
To work, this extension requires the following of server operators:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
Generating bundle files of repository content (typically periodically,
such as once per day).
.IP \(bu 2
.
Clone bundles: A file server that clients have network access to and that
Python knows how to talk to through its normal URL handling facility
(typically an HTTP/HTTPS server).
.IP \(bu 2
.
A process for keeping the bundles manifest in sync with available bundle
files.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Strictly speaking, using a static file hosting server isn\(aqt required: a server
operator could use a dynamic service for retrieving bundle data. However,
static file hosting services are simple and scalable and should be sufficient
for most needs.
.sp
Bundle files can be generated with the \%\fBhg bundle\fP\: command. Typically
\%\fBhg bundle \-\-all\fP\: is used to produce a bundle of the entire repository.
.sp
The bundlespec option \fIstream\fP (see \%\fBhg help bundlespec\fP\:)
can be used to produce a special \fIstreaming clonebundle\fP, typically using
\%\fBhg bundle \-\-all \-\-type="none\-streamv2"\fP\:.
These are bundle files that are extremely efficient
to produce and consume (read: fast). However, they are larger than
traditional bundle formats and require that clients support the exact set
of repository data store formats in use by the repository that created them.
Typically, a newer server can serve data that is compatible with older clients.
However, \fIstreaming clone bundles\fP don\(aqt have this guarantee. \fBServer
operators need to be aware that newer versions of Mercurial may produce
streaming clone bundles incompatible with older Mercurial versions.\fP
.sp
A server operator is responsible for creating a \fB.hg/clonebundles.manifest\fP
file containing the list of available bundle files suitable for seeding
clones. If this file does not exist, the repository will not advertise the
existence of clone bundles when clients connect. For pull bundles,
\fB.hg/pullbundles.manifest\fP is used.
.sp
The manifest file contains a newline (n) delimited list of entries.
.sp
Each line in this file defines an available bundle. Lines have the format:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
<URL> [<key>=<value>[ <key>=<value>]]
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
That is, a URL followed by an optional, space\-delimited list of key=value
pairs describing additional properties of this bundle. Both keys and values
are URI encoded.
.sp
For pull bundles, the URL is a path under the \fB.hg\fP directory of the
repository.
.sp
Keys in UPPERCASE are reserved for use by Mercurial and are defined below.
All non\-uppercase keys can be used by site installations. An example use
for custom properties is to use the \fIdatacenter\fP attribute to define which
data center a file is hosted in. Clients could then prefer a server in the
data center closest to them.
.sp
The following reserved keys are currently defined:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B BUNDLESPEC
.
A "bundle specification" string that describes the type of the bundle.
.sp
These are string values that are accepted by the "\-\-type" argument of
\%\fBhg bundle\fP\:.
.sp
The values are parsed in strict mode, which means they must be of the
"<compression>\-<type>" form. See
mercurial.exchange.parsebundlespec() for more details.
.sp
\%\fBhg debugbundle \-\-spec\fP\: can be used to print the bundle specification
string for a bundle file. The output of this command can be used verbatim
for the value of \fBBUNDLESPEC\fP (it is already escaped).
.sp
Clients will automatically filter out specifications that are unknown or
unsupported so they won\(aqt attempt to download something that likely won\(aqt
apply.
.sp
The actual value doesn\(aqt impact client behavior beyond filtering:
clients will still sniff the bundle type from the header of downloaded
files.
.sp
\fBUse of this key is highly recommended\fP, as it allows clients to
easily skip unsupported bundles. If this key is not defined, an old
client may attempt to apply a bundle that it is incapable of reading.
.TP
.B REQUIRESNI
.
Whether Server Name Indication (SNI) is required to connect to the URL.
SNI allows servers to use multiple certificates on the same IP. It is
somewhat common in CDNs and other hosting providers. Older Python
versions do not support SNI. Defining this attribute enables clients
with older Python versions to filter this entry without experiencing
an opaque SSL failure at connection time.
.sp
If this is defined, it is important to advertise a non\-SNI fallback
URL or clients running old Python releases may not be able to clone
with the clonebundles facility.
.sp
Value should be "true".
.TP
.B REQUIREDRAM
.
Value specifies expected memory requirements to decode the payload.
Values can have suffixes for common bytes sizes. e.g. "64MB".
.sp
This key is often used with zstd\-compressed bundles using a high
compression level / window size, which can require 100+ MB of memory
to decode.
.TP
.B heads
.
Used for pull bundles. This contains the \fB;\fP separated changeset
hashes of the heads of the bundle content.
.TP
.B bases
.
Used for pull bundles. This contains the \fB;\fP separated changeset
hashes of the roots of the bundle content. This can be skipped if
the bundle was created without \fB\-\-base\fP.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Manifests can contain multiple entries. Assuming metadata is defined, clients
will filter entries from the manifest that they don\(aqt support. The remaining
entries are optionally sorted by client preferences
(\fBui.clonebundleprefers\fP config option). The client then attempts
to fetch the bundle at the first URL in the remaining list.
.sp
\fBErrors when downloading a bundle will fail the entire clone operation:
clients do not automatically fall back to a traditional clone.\fP The reason
for this is that if a server is using clone bundles, it is probably doing so
because the feature is necessary to help it scale. In other words, there
is an assumption that clone load will be offloaded to another service and
that the Mercurial server isn\(aqt responsible for serving this clone load.
If that other service experiences issues and clients start mass falling back to
the original Mercurial server, the added clone load could overwhelm the server
due to unexpected load and effectively take it offline. Not having clients
automatically fall back to cloning from the original server mitigates this
scenario.
.sp
Because there is no automatic Mercurial server fallback on failure of the
bundle hosting service, it is important for server operators to view the bundle
hosting service as an extension of the Mercurial server in terms of
availability and service level agreements: if the bundle hosting service goes
down, so does the ability for clients to clone. Note: clients will see a
message informing them how to bypass the clone bundles facility when a failure
occurs. So server operators should prepare for some people to follow these
instructions when a failure occurs, thus driving more load to the original
Mercurial server when the bundle hosting service fails.
.SS inline clonebundles
.sp
It is possible to transmit clonebundles inline in case repositories are
accessed over SSH. This avoids having to setup an external HTTPS server
and results in the same access control as already present for the SSH setup.
.sp
Inline clonebundles should be placed into the \fI.hg/bundle\-cache\fP directory.
A clonebundle at \fI.hg/bundle\-cache/mybundle.bundle\fP is referred to
in the \fIclonebundles.manifest\fP file as \fIpeer\-bundle\-cache://mybundle.bundle\fP.
.SS auto\-generation of clone bundles
.sp
It is possible to set Mercurial to automatically re\-generate clone bundles when
enough new content is available.
.sp
Mercurial will take care of the process asynchronously. The defined list of
bundle\-type will be generated, uploaded, and advertised. Older bundles will get
decommissioned as newer ones replace them.
.SS Bundles Generation:
.sp
The extension can generate multiple variants of the clone bundle. Each
different variant will be defined by the "bundle\-spec" they use:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[clone\-bundles]
auto\-generate.formats= zstd\-v2, gzip\-v2
.ft P
.fi
.sp
See \fIhg help bundlespec\fP for details about available options.
.sp
By default, new bundles are generated when 5% of the repository contents or at
least 1000 revisions are not contained in the cached bundles. This option can
be controlled by the \fIclone\-bundles.trigger.below\-bundled\-ratio\fP option
(default 0.95) and the \fIclone\-bundles.trigger.revs\fP option (default 1000):
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[clone\-bundles]
trigger.below\-bundled\-ratio=0.95
trigger.revs=1000
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This logic can be manually triggered using the \fIadmin::clone\-bundles\-refresh\fP
command, or automatically on each repository change if
\fIclone\-bundles.auto\-generate.on\-change\fP is set to \fIyes\fP:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[clone\-bundles]
auto\-generate.on\-change=yes
auto\-generate.formats= zstd\-v2, gzip\-v2
.ft P
.fi
.SS Automatic Inline serving
.sp
The simplest way to serve the generated bundle is through the Mercurial
protocol. However it is not the most efficient as request will still be served
by that main server. It is useful in case where authentication is complexe or
when an efficient mirror system is already in use anyway. See the \fIinline
clonebundles\fP section above for details about inline clonebundles
.sp
To automatically serve generated bundle through inline clonebundle, simply set
the following option:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
auto\-generate.serve\-inline=yes
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Enabling this option disable the managed upload and serving explained below.
.SS Bundles Upload and Serving:
.sp
This is the most efficient way to serve automatically generated clone bundles,
but requires some setup.
.sp
The generated bundles need to be made available to users through a "public" URL.
This should be donne through \fIclone\-bundles.upload\-command\fP configuration. The
value of this command should be a shell command. It will have access to the
bundle file path through the \fI$HGCB_BUNDLE_PATH\fP variable. And the expected
basename in the "public" URL is accessible at:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[clone\-bundles]
upload\-command=sftp put $HGCB_BUNDLE_PATH       sftp://bundles.host/clone\-bundles/$HGCB_BUNDLE_BASENAME
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If the file was already uploaded, the command must still succeed.
.sp
After upload, the file should be available at an url defined by
\fIclone\-bundles.url\-template\fP.

the \fI$HGCB_BUNDLE_URL\fP environment variable.

Empty lines and lines starting with a \fB#\fP are ignored.
.sp
The filemap is a file that allows filtering and remapping of files
and directories. Each line can contain one of the following
directives:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
include path/to/file\-or\-dir

exclude path/to/file\-or\-dir

rename path/to/source path/to/destination
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Comment lines start with \fB#\fP. A specified path matches if it
equals the full relative name of a file or one of its parent
directories. The \fBinclude\fP or \fBexclude\fP directive with the
longest matching path applies, so line order does not matter.
.sp
The \fBinclude\fP directive causes a file, or all files under a
directory, to be included in the destination repository. The default
if there are no \fBinclude\fP statements is to include everything.
If there are any \fBinclude\fP statements, nothing else is included.
The \fBexclude\fP directive causes files or directories to
be omitted. The \fBrename\fP directive renames a file or directory if
it is converted. To rename from a subdirectory into the root of
the repository, use \fB.\fP as the path to rename to.
.sp
\fB\-\-full\fP will make sure the converted changesets contain exactly
the right files with the right content. It will make a full
conversion of all files, not just the ones that have
changed. Files that already are correct will not be changed. This
can be used to apply filemap changes when converting
incrementally. This is currently only supported for Mercurial and
Subversion.
.sp
The splicemap is a file that allows insertion of synthetic
history, letting you specify the parents of a revision. This is
useful if you want to e.g. give a Subversion merge two parents, or
graft two disconnected series of history together. Each entry
contains a key, followed by a space, followed by one or two
comma\-separated values:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
key parent1, parent2
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The key is the revision ID in the source
revision control system whose parents should be modified (same
format as a key in .hg/shamap). The values are the revision IDs
(in either the source or destination revision control system) that
should be used as the new parents for that node. For example, if
you have merged "release\-1.0" into "trunk", then you should
specify the revision on "trunk" as the first parent and the one on
the "release\-1.0" branch as the second.
.sp
The branchmap is a file that allows you to rename a branch when it is
being brought in from whatever external repository. When used in
conjunction with a splicemap, it allows for a powerful combination
to help fix even the most badly mismanaged repositories and turn them
into nicely structured Mercurial repositories. The branchmap contains
lines of the form:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
original_branch_name new_branch_name
.ft P
.fi
.sp
where "original_branch_name" is the name of the branch in the
source repository, and "new_branch_name" is the name of the branch
is the destination repository. No whitespace is allowed in the new
branch name. This can be used to (for instance) move code in one
repository from "default" to a named branch.
.SS Mercurial Source
.sp
The Mercurial source recognizes the following configuration
options, which you can set on the command line with \fB\-\-config\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B convert.hg.ignoreerrors
.
ignore integrity errors when reading.
Use it to fix Mercurial repositories with missing revlogs, by
converting from and to Mercurial. Default is False.
.TP
.B convert.hg.saverev
.
store original revision ID in changeset
(forces target IDs to change). It takes a boolean argument and
defaults to False.
.TP
.B convert.hg.startrev
.
specify the initial Mercurial revision.
The default is 0.
.TP
.B convert.hg.revs
.
revset specifying the source revisions to convert.
.UNINDENT
.SS Bazaar Source
.sp
The following options can be used with \fB\-\-config\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B convert.bzr.saverev
.
whether to store the original Bazaar commit ID in
the metadata of the destination commit. The default is True.
.UNINDENT
.SS CVS Source
.sp
CVS source will use a sandbox (i.e. a checked\-out copy) from CVS
to indicate the starting point of what will be converted. Direct
access to the repository files is not needed, unless of course the
repository is \fB:local:\fP. The conversion uses the top level
directory in the sandbox to find the CVS repository, and then uses
CVS rlog commands to find files to convert. This means that unless
a filemap is given, all files under the starting directory will be
converted, and that any directory reorganization in the CVS
sandbox is ignored.
.sp
The following options can be used with \fB\-\-config\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B convert.cvsps.cache
.
Set to False to disable remote log caching,
for testing and debugging purposes. Default is True.
.TP
.B convert.cvsps.fuzz
.
Specify the maximum time (in seconds) that is
allowed between commits with identical user and log message in
a single changeset. When very large files were checked in as
part of a changeset then the default may not be long enough.
The default is 60.
.TP
.B convert.cvsps.logencoding
.
Specify encoding name to be used for
transcoding CVS log messages. Multiple encoding names can be
specified as a list (see \%\fBhg help config.Syntax\fP\:), but only
the first acceptable encoding in the list is used per CVS log
entries. This transcoding is executed before cvslog hook below.
.TP
.B convert.cvsps.mergeto
.
Specify a regular expression to which
commit log messages are matched. If a match occurs, then the
conversion process will insert a dummy revision merging the
branch on which this log message occurs to the branch
indicated in the regex. Default is \fB{{mergetobranch
([\-\ew]+)}}\fP
.TP
.B convert.cvsps.mergefrom
.
Specify a regular expression to which
commit log messages are matched. If a match occurs, then the
conversion process will add the most recent revision on the
branch indicated in the regex as the second parent of the
changeset. Default is \fB{{mergefrombranch ([\-\ew]+)}}\fP
.TP
.B convert.localtimezone
.
use local time (as determined by the TZ
environment variable) for changeset date/times. The default
is False (use UTC).
.TP
.B hooks.cvslog
.
Specify a Python function to be called at the end of
gathering the CVS log. The function is passed a list with the
log entries, and can modify the entries in\-place, or add or
delete them.
.TP
.B hooks.cvschangesets
.
Specify a Python function to be called after
the changesets are calculated from the CVS log. The
function is passed a list with the changeset entries, and can
modify the changesets in\-place, or add or delete them.
.UNINDENT
.sp
An additional "debugcvsps" Mercurial command allows the builtin
changeset merging code to be run without doing a conversion. Its
parameters and output are similar to that of cvsps 2.1. Please see
the command help for more details.
.SS Subversion Source
.sp
Subversion source detects classical trunk/branches/tags layouts.
By default, the supplied \fBsvn://repo/path/\fP source URL is
converted as a single branch. If \fBsvn://repo/path/trunk\fP exists
it replaces the default branch. If \fBsvn://repo/path/branches\fP
exists, its subdirectories are listed as possible branches. If
\fBsvn://repo/path/tags\fP exists, it is looked for tags referencing
converted branches. Default \fBtrunk\fP, \fBbranches\fP and \fBtags\fP
values can be overridden with following options. Set them to paths
relative to the source URL, or leave them blank to disable auto
detection.
.sp
The following options can be set with \fB\-\-config\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B convert.svn.branches
.
specify the directory containing branches.
The default is \fBbranches\fP.
.TP
.B convert.svn.tags
.
specify the directory containing tags. The
default is \fBtags\fP.
.TP
.B convert.svn.trunk
.
specify the name of the trunk branch. The
default is \fBtrunk\fP.
.TP
.B convert.localtimezone
.
use local time (as determined by the TZ
environment variable) for changeset date/times. The default
is False (use UTC).
.UNINDENT
.sp
Source history can be retrieved starting at a specific revision,
instead of being integrally converted. Only single branch
conversions are supported.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B convert.svn.startrev
.
specify start Subversion revision number.
The default is 0.
.UNINDENT
.SS Git Source
.sp
The Git importer converts commits from all reachable branches (refs
in refs/heads) and remotes (refs in refs/remotes) to Mercurial.
Branches are converted to bookmarks with the same name, with the
leading \(aqrefs/heads\(aq stripped. Git submodules are converted to Git
subrepos in Mercurial.
.sp
The following options can be set with \fB\-\-config\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B convert.git.similarity
.
specify how similar files modified in a
commit must be to be imported as renames or copies, as a
percentage between \fB0\fP (disabled) and \fB100\fP (files must be
identical). For example, \fB90\fP means that a delete/add pair will
be imported as a rename if more than 90% of the file hasn\(aqt
changed. The default is \fB50\fP.
.TP
.B convert.git.findcopiesharder
.
while detecting copies, look at all
files in the working copy instead of just changed ones. This
is very expensive for large projects, and is only effective when
\fBconvert.git.similarity\fP is greater than 0. The default is False.
.TP
.B convert.git.renamelimit
.
perform rename and copy detection up to this
many changed files in a commit. Increasing this will make rename
and copy detection more accurate but will significantly slow down
computation on large projects. The option is only relevant if
\fBconvert.git.similarity\fP is greater than 0. The default is
\fB400\fP.
.TP
.B convert.git.committeractions
.
list of actions to take when processing
author and committer values.
.sp
Git commits have separate author (who wrote the commit) and committer
(who applied the commit) fields. Not all destinations support separate
author and committer fields (including Mercurial). This config option
controls what to do with these author and committer fields during
conversion.
.sp
A value of \fBmessagedifferent\fP will append a \fBcommitter: ...\fP
line to the commit message if the Git committer is different from the
author. The prefix of that line can be specified using the syntax
\fBmessagedifferent=<prefix>\fP. e.g. \fBmessagedifferent=git\-committer:\fP.
When a prefix is specified, a space will always be inserted between the
prefix and the value.
.sp
\fBmessagealways\fP behaves like \fBmessagedifferent\fP except it will
always result in a \fBcommitter: ...\fP line being appended to the commit
message. This value is mutually exclusive with \fBmessagedifferent\fP.
.sp
\fBdropcommitter\fP will remove references to the committer. Only
references to the author will remain. Actions that add references
to the committer will have no effect when this is set.
.sp
\fBreplaceauthor\fP will replace the value of the author field with
the committer. Other actions that add references to the committer
will still take effect when this is set.
.sp
The default is \fBmessagedifferent\fP.
.TP
.B convert.git.extrakeys
.
list of extra keys from commit metadata to copy to
the destination. Some Git repositories store extra metadata in commits.
By default, this non\-default metadata will be lost during conversion.
Setting this config option can retain that metadata. Some built\-in
keys such as \fBparent\fP and \fBbranch\fP are not allowed to be copied.
.TP
.B convert.git.remoteprefix
.
remote refs are converted as bookmarks with
\fBconvert.git.remoteprefix\fP as a prefix followed by a /. The default
is \(aqremote\(aq.
.TP
.B convert.git.saverev
.
whether to store the original Git commit ID in the
metadata of the destination commit. The default is True.
.TP
.B convert.git.skipsubmodules
.
does not convert root level .gitmodules files
or files with 160000 mode indicating a submodule. Default is False.
.UNINDENT
.SS Perforce Source
.sp
The Perforce (P4) importer can be given a p4 depot path or a
client specification as source. It will convert all files in the
source to a flat Mercurial repository, ignoring labels, branches
and integrations. Note that when a depot path is given you then
usually should specify a target directory, because otherwise the
target may be named \fB...\-hg\fP.
.sp
The following options can be set with \fB\-\-config\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B convert.p4.encoding
.
specify the encoding to use when decoding standard
output of the Perforce command line tool. The default is default system
encoding.
.TP
.B convert.p4.startrev
.
specify initial Perforce revision (a
Perforce changelist number).
.UNINDENT
.SS Mercurial Destination
.sp
The Mercurial destination will recognize Mercurial subrepositories in the
destination directory, and update the .hgsubstate file automatically if the
destination subrepositories contain the <dest>/<sub>/.hg/shamap file.
Converting a repository with subrepositories requires converting a single
repository at a time, from the bottom up.
.sp
An example showing how to convert a repository with subrepositories:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# so convert knows the type when it sees a non empty destination
$ hg init converted

$ hg convert orig/sub1 converted/sub1
$ hg convert orig/sub2 converted/sub2
$ hg convert orig converted
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The following options are supported:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B convert.hg.clonebranches
.
dispatch source branches in separate
clones. The default is False.
.TP
.B convert.hg.tagsbranch
.
branch name for tag revisions, defaults to
\fBdefault\fP.
.TP
.B convert.hg.usebranchnames
.
preserve branch names. The default is
True.
.TP
.B convert.hg.sourcename
.
records the given string as a \(aqconvert_source\(aq extra
value on each commit made in the target repository. The default is None.
.TP
.B convert.hg.preserve\-hash
.
only works with mercurial sources. Make convert
prevent performance improvement to the list of modified files in commits
when such an improvement would cause the hash of a commit to change.
The default is False.
.UNINDENT
.SS All Destinations
.sp
All destination types accept the following options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B convert.skiptags
.
does not convert tags from the source repo to the target
repo. The default is False.
.UNINDENT
.SS Subversion Destination
.sp
Original commit dates are not preserved by default.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B convert.svn.dangerous\-set\-commit\-dates
.
preserve original commit dates,
forcefully setting \fBsvn:date\fP revision properties. This option is
DANGEROUS and may break some subversion functionality for the resulting
repository (e.g. filtering revisions with date ranges in \fBsvn log\fP),
as original commit dates are not guaranteed to be monotonically
increasing.
.UNINDENT
.sp
For commit dates setting to work destination repository must have
\fBpre\-revprop\-change\fP hook configured to allow setting of \fBsvn:date\fP

.SS eol
.sp
automatically manage newlines in repository files
.sp
This extension allows you to manage the type of line endings (CRLF or
LF) that are used in the repository and in the local working
directory. That way you can get CRLF line endings on Windows and LF on
Unix/Mac, thereby letting everybody use their OS native line endings.
.sp
The extension reads its configuration from a versioned \fB.hgeol\fP
configuration file found in the root of the working directory. The
\fB.hgeol\fP file use the same syntax as all other Mercurial
configuration files. It uses two sections, \fB[patterns]\fP and
\fB[repository]\fP.
.sp
The \fB[patterns]\fP section specifies how line endings should be
converted between the working directory and the repository. The format is
specified by a file pattern. The first match is used, so put more
specific patterns first. The available line endings are \fBLF\fP,
\fBCRLF\fP, and \fBBIN\fP.
.sp
Files with the declared format of \fBCRLF\fP or \fBLF\fP are always
checked out and stored in the repository in that format and files
declared to be binary (\fBBIN\fP) are left unchanged. Additionally,
\fBnative\fP is an alias for checking out in the platform\(aqs default line
ending: \fBLF\fP on Unix (including Mac OS X) and \fBCRLF\fP on
Windows. Note that \fBBIN\fP (do nothing to line endings) is Mercurial\(aqs
default behavior; it is only needed if you need to override a later,
more general pattern.
.sp
The optional \fB[repository]\fP section specifies the line endings to
use for files stored in the repository. It has a single setting,
\fBnative\fP, which determines the storage line endings for files
declared as \fBnative\fP in the \fB[patterns]\fP section. It can be set to
\fBLF\fP or \fBCRLF\fP. The default is \fBLF\fP. For example, this means
that on Windows, files configured as \fBnative\fP (\fBCRLF\fP by default)
will be converted to \fBLF\fP when stored in the repository. Files
declared as \fBLF\fP, \fBCRLF\fP, or \fBBIN\fP in the \fB[patterns]\fP section
are always stored as\-is in the repository.
.sp
Example versioned \fB.hgeol\fP file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[patterns]
**.py = native
**.vcproj = CRLF
**.txt = native
Makefile = LF
**.jpg = BIN

[repository]
native = LF
.ft P
.fi
.IP Note
.
The rules will first apply when files are touched in the working
directory, e.g. by updating to null and back to tip to touch all files.
.RE
.sp
The extension uses an optional \fB[eol]\fP section read from both the
normal Mercurial configuration files and the \fB.hgeol\fP file, with the
latter overriding the former. You can use that section to control the
overall behavior. There are three settings:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBeol.native\fP (default \fBos.linesep\fP) can be set to \fBLF\fP or
\fBCRLF\fP to override the default interpretation of \fBnative\fP for
checkout. This can be used with \%\fBhg archive\fP\: on Unix, say, to
generate an archive where files have line endings for Windows.
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBeol.only\-consistent\fP (default True) can be set to False to make
the extension convert files with inconsistent EOLs. Inconsistent
means that there is both \fBCRLF\fP and \fBLF\fP present in the file.
Such files are normally not touched under the assumption that they
have mixed EOLs on purpose.
.IP \(bu 2
.
\fBeol.fix\-trailing\-newline\fP (default False) can be set to True to
ensure that converted files end with a EOL character (either \fB\en\fP
or \fB\er\en\fP as per the configured patterns).
.UNINDENT
.sp
The extension provides \fBcleverencode:\fP and \fBcleverdecode:\fP filters
like the deprecated win32text extension does. This means that you can
disable win32text and enable eol and your filters will still work. You
only need to these filters until you have prepared a \fB.hgeol\fP file.
.sp
The \fBwin32text.forbid*\fP hooks provided by the win32text extension
have been unified into a single hook named \fBeol.checkheadshook\fP. The
hook will lookup the expected line endings from the \fB.hgeol\fP file,
which means you must migrate to a \fB.hgeol\fP file first before using
the hook. \fBeol.checkheadshook\fP only checks heads, intermediate
invalid revisions will be pushed. To forbid them completely, use the
\fBeol.checkallhook\fP hook. These hooks are best used as
\fBpretxnchangegroup\fP hooks.
.sp
See \%\fBhg help patterns\fP\: for more information about the glob patterns
used.
.SS extdiff
.sp
command to allow external programs to compare revisions
.sp
The extdiff Mercurial extension allows you to use external programs
to compare revisions, or revision with working directory. The external
diff programs are called with a configurable set of options and two
non\-option arguments: paths to directories containing snapshots of
files to compare.
.sp
If there is more than one file being compared and the "child" revision
is the working directory, any modifications made in the external diff
program will be copied back to the working directory from the temporary
directory.
.sp
The extdiff extension also allows you to configure new diff commands, so
you do not need to type \%\fBhg extdiff \-p kdiff3\fP\: always.
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[extdiff]
# add new command that runs GNU diff(1) in \(aqcontext diff\(aq mode
cdiff = gdiff \-Nprc5
## or the old way:
#cmd.cdiff = gdiff

# add new command called meld, runs meld (no need to name twice).  If
# the meld executable is not available, the meld tool in [merge\-tools]
# will be used, if available

.sp
Tool arguments can include variables that are expanded at runtime:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$parent1, $plabel1 \- filename, descriptive label of first parent
$child,   $clabel  \- filename, descriptive label of child revision
$parent2, $plabel2 \- filename, descriptive label of second parent
$root              \- repository root
$parent is an alias for $parent1.
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The extdiff extension will look in your [diff\-tools] and [merge\-tools]
sections for diff tool arguments, when none are specified in [extdiff].
.sp

kdiff3 =

[diff\-tools]
kdiff3.diffargs=\-\-L1 \(aq$plabel1\(aq \-\-L2 \(aq$clabel\(aq $parent $child
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If a program has a graphical interface, it might be interesting to tell
Mercurial about it. It will prevent the program from being mistakenly
used in a terminal\-only environment (such as an SSH terminal session),
and will make \%\fBhg extdiff \-\-per\-file\fP\: open multiple file diffs at once
instead of one by one (if you still want to open file diffs one by one,
you can use the \-\-confirm option).
.sp
Declaring that a tool has a graphical interface can be done with the
\fBgui\fP flag next to where \fBdiffargs\fP are specified:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[diff\-tools]
kdiff3.diffargs=\-\-L1 \(aq$plabel1\(aq \-\-L2 \(aq$clabel\(aq $parent $child
kdiff3.gui = true
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can use \-I/\-X and list of file or directory names like normal
\%\fBhg diff\fP\: command. The extdiff extension makes snapshots of only
needed files, so running the external diff program will actually be
pretty fast (at least faster than having to compare the entire tree).
.SS Commands

.sp
Show differences between revisions for the specified files, using
an external program. The default program used is diff, with
default options "\-Npru".
.sp
To select a different program, use the \-p/\-\-program option. The
program will be passed the names of two directories to compare,
unless the \-\-per\-file option is specified (see below). To pass
additional options to the program, use \-o/\-\-option. These will be
passed before the names of the directories or files to compare.
.sp
The \-\-from, \-\-to, and \-\-change options work the same way they do for
\%\fBhg diff\fP\:.
.sp
The \-\-per\-file option runs the external program repeatedly on each
file to diff, instead of once on two directories. By default,
this happens one by one, where the next file diff is open in the
external program only once the previous external program (for the
previous file diff) has exited. If the external program has a
graphical interface, it can open all the file diffs at once instead
of one by one. See \%\fBhg help \-e extdiff\fP\: for information about how
to tell Mercurial that a given program has a graphical interface.

The executable entry defines the full path to the factotum binary. The
mountpoint entry defines the path to the factotum file service. Lastly, the
service entry controls the service name used when reading keys.
.SS fastannotate
.sp
yet another annotate implementation that might be faster (EXPERIMENTAL)
.sp
The fastannotate extension provides a \(aqfastannotate\(aq command that makes
use of the linelog data structure as a cache layer and is expected to
be faster than the vanilla \(aqannotate\(aq if the cache is present.
.sp
In most cases, fastannotate requires a setup that mainbranch is some pointer
that always moves forward, to be most efficient.
.sp
Using fastannotate together with linkrevcache would speed up building the
annotate cache greatly. Run "debugbuildlinkrevcache" before
"debugbuildannotatecache".
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[fastannotate]
# specify the main branch head. the internal linelog will only contain
# the linear (ignoring p2) "mainbranch". since linelog cannot move
# backwards without a rebuild, this should be something that always moves
# forward, usually it is "master" or "@".
mainbranch = master

# fastannotate supports different modes to expose its feature.
# a list of combination:
# \- fastannotate: expose the feature via the "fastannotate" command which
#   deals with everything in a most efficient way, and provides extra
#   features like \-\-deleted etc.
# \- fctx: replace fctx.annotate implementation. note:
#     a. it is less efficient than the "fastannotate" command
#     b. it will make it practically impossible to access the old (disk
#        side\-effect free) annotate implementation
#     c. it implies "hgweb".
# \- hgweb: replace hgweb\(aqs annotate implementation. conflict with "fctx".

.SS fix
.sp
rewrite file content in changesets or working copy (EXPERIMENTAL)
.sp
Provides a command that runs configured tools on the contents of modified files,
writing back any fixes to the working copy or replacing changesets.
.sp
Fixer tools are run in the repository\(aqs root directory. This allows them to read
configuration files from the working copy, or even write to the working copy.
The working copy is not updated to match the revision being fixed. In fact,
several revisions may be fixed in parallel. Writes to the working copy are not
amended into the revision being fixed; fixer tools MUST always read content to
be fixed from stdin, and write fixed file content back to stdout.
.sp
Here is an example configuration that causes \%\fBhg fix\fP\: to apply automatic
formatting fixes to modified lines in C++ code:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[fix]
clang\-format:command=clang\-format \-\-assume\-filename={rootpath}
clang\-format:linerange=\-\-lines={first}:{last}
clang\-format:pattern=set:**.cpp or **.hpp
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The :command suboption forms the first part of the shell command that will be
used to fix a file. The content of the file is passed on standard input, and the
fixed file content is expected on standard output. Any output on standard error
will be displayed as a warning. If the exit status is not zero, the file will
not be affected. A placeholder warning is displayed if there is a non\-zero exit
status but no standard error output. Some values may be substituted into the
command:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{rootpath}  The path of the file being fixed, relative to the repo root
{basename}  The name of the file being fixed, without the directory path
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If the :linerange suboption is set, the tool will only be run if there are
changed lines in a file. The value of this suboption is appended to the shell
command once for every range of changed lines in the file. Some values may be
substituted into the command:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
{first}   The 1\-based line number of the first line in the modified range
{last}    The 1\-based line number of the last line in the modified range
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Deleted sections of a file will be ignored by :linerange, because there is no
corresponding line range in the version being fixed.
.sp
By default, tools that set :linerange will only be executed if there is at least
one changed line range. This is meant to prevent accidents like running a code
formatter in such a way that it unexpectedly reformats the whole file. If such a
tool needs to operate on unchanged files, it should set the :skipclean suboption
to false.
.sp
The :pattern suboption determines which files will be passed through each
configured tool. See \%\fBhg help patterns\fP\: for possible values. However, all
patterns are relative to the repo root, even if that text says they are relative
to the current working directory. If there are file arguments to \%\fBhg fix\fP\:, the
intersection of these patterns is used.
.sp
There is also a configurable limit for the maximum size of file that will be
processed by \%\fBhg fix\fP\::
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[fix]
maxfilesize = 2MB
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Normally, execution of configured tools will continue after a failure (indicated
by a non\-zero exit status). It can also be configured to abort after the first
such failure, so that no files will be affected if any tool fails. This abort
will also cause \%\fBhg fix\fP\: to exit with a non\-zero status:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[fix]
failure = abort
.ft P
.fi
.sp
When multiple tools are configured to affect a file, they execute in an order
defined by the :priority suboption. The priority suboption has a default value
of zero for each tool. Tools are executed in order of descending priority. The
execution order of tools with equal priority is unspecified. For example, you
could use the \(aqsort\(aq and \(aqhead\(aq utilities to keep only the 10 smallest numbers
in a text file by ensuring that \(aqsort\(aq runs before \(aqhead\(aq:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[fix]
sort:command = sort \-n
head:command = head \-n 10
sort:pattern = numbers.txt
head:pattern = numbers.txt
sort:priority = 2
head:priority = 1
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To account for changes made by each tool, the line numbers used for incremental
formatting are recomputed before executing the next tool. So, each tool may see
different values for the arguments added by the :linerange suboption.
.sp
Each fixer tool is allowed to return some metadata in addition to the fixed file
content. The metadata must be placed before the file content on stdout,
separated from the file content by a zero byte. The metadata is parsed as a JSON
value (so, it should be UTF\-8 encoded and contain no zero bytes). A fixer tool
is expected to produce this metadata encoding if and only if the :metadata
suboption is true:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[fix]
tool:command = tool \-\-prepend\-json\-metadata
tool:metadata = true
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The metadata values are passed to hooks, which can be used to print summaries or
perform other post\-fixing work. The supported hooks are:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
"postfixfile"
  Run once for each file in each revision where any fixer tools made changes
  to the file content. Provides "$HG_REV" and "$HG_PATH" to identify the file,
  and "$HG_METADATA" with a map of fixer names to metadata values from fixer
  tools that affected the file. Fixer tools that didn\(aqt affect the file have a
  value of None. Only fixer tools that executed are present in the metadata.

"postfix"
  Run once after all files and revisions have been handled. Provides
  "$HG_REPLACEMENTS" with information about what revisions were created and
  made obsolete. Provides a boolean "$HG_WDIRWRITTEN" to indicate whether any
  files in the working copy were updated. Provides a list "$HG_METADATA"
  mapping fixer tool names to lists of metadata values returned from
  executions that modified a file. This aggregates the same metadata
  previously passed to the "postfixfile" hook.

\%\fBhg help \-e fix\fP\: for details about configuring tools.) Only affects files
with changes, unless file arguments are provided. Only affects changed lines
of files, unless the \-\-whole flag is used. Some tools may always affect the
whole file regardless of \-\-whole.
.sp
If \-\-working\-dir is used, files with uncommitted changes in the working copy
will be fixed. Note that no backup are made.
.sp
If revisions are specified with \-\-source, those revisions and their
descendants will be checked, and they may be replaced with new revisions
that have fixed file content. By automatically including the descendants,
no merging, rebasing, or evolution will be required. If an ancestor of the
working copy is included, then the working copy itself will also be fixed,
and the working copy will be updated to the fixed parent.
.sp
When determining what lines of each file to fix at each revision, the whole
set of revisions being fixed is considered, so that fixes to earlier
revisions are not forgotten in later ones. The \-\-base flag can be used to
override this default behavior, though it is not usually desirable to do so.

.SS fsmonitor
.sp
Faster status operations with the Watchman file monitor (EXPERIMENTAL)
.sp
Integrates the file\-watching program Watchman with Mercurial to produce faster
status results.
.sp
On a particular Linux system, for a real\-world repository with over 400,000
files hosted on ext4, vanilla \fIhg status\fP takes 1.3 seconds. On the same
system, with fsmonitor it takes about 0.3 seconds.
.sp
fsmonitor requires no configuration \-\- it will tell Watchman about your
repository as necessary. You\(aqll need to install Watchman from
\%https://facebook.github.io/watchman/\: and make sure it is in your PATH.
.sp
fsmonitor is incompatible with the largefiles and eol extensions, and
will disable itself if any of those are active.
.sp
The following configuration options exist:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[fsmonitor]
mode = {off, on, paranoid}
.ft P
.fi
.sp
When \fImode = off\fP, fsmonitor will disable itself (similar to not loading the
extension at all). When \fImode = on\fP, fsmonitor will be enabled (the default).
When \fImode = paranoid\fP, fsmonitor will query both Watchman and the filesystem,
and ensure that the results are consistent.

have been changed. Walking the repo in that case can result in competing for
I/O with Watchman. For large repos it is recommended to set this value to
false. You may wish to set this to true if you have a very fast filesystem

browse the repository in a graphical way
.sp
The hgk extension allows browsing the history of a repository in a
graphical way. It requires Tcl/Tk version 8.4 or later. (Tcl/Tk is not
distributed with Mercurial.)
.sp
hgk consists of two parts: a Tcl script that does the displaying and
querying of information, and an extension to Mercurial named hgk.py,
which provides hooks for hgk to get information. hgk can be found in
the contrib directory, and the extension is shipped in the hgext
repository, and needs to be enabled.
.sp
The \%\fBhg view\fP\: command will launch the hgk Tcl script. For this command
to work, hgk must be in your search path. Alternately, you can specify
the path to hgk in your configuration file:
.sp

In this file, lines beginning with \fB#\fP are ignored. You must specify a rule
for each revision in your history. For example, if you had meant to add gamma
before beta, and then wanted to add delta in the same revision as beta, you
would reorganize the file to look like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
pick 030b686bedc4 Add gamma
pick c561b4e977df Add beta
fold 7c2fd3b9020c Add delta

# Edit history between c561b4e977df and 7c2fd3b9020c
#
# Commits are listed from least to most recent
#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  e, edit = use commit, but allow edits before making new commit
#  f, fold = use commit, but combine it with the one above
#  r, roll = like fold, but discard this commit\(aqs description and date
#  d, drop = remove commit from history
#  m, mess = edit commit message without changing commit content
#  b, base = checkout changeset and apply further changesets from there
#
.ft P
.fi
.sp
At which point you close the editor and \fBhistedit\fP starts working. When you
specify a \fBfold\fP operation, \fBhistedit\fP will open an editor when it folds
those revisions together, offering you a chance to clean up the commit message:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
Add beta
***
Add delta
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Edit the commit message to your liking, then close the editor. The date used
for the commit will be the later of the two commits\(aq dates. For this example,
let\(aqs assume that the commit message was changed to \fBAdd beta and delta.\fP
After histedit has run and had a chance to remove any old or temporary
revisions it needed, the history looks like this:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
@  2[tip]   989b4d060121   2009\-04\-27 18:04 \-0500   durin42
|    Add beta and delta.

     Add alpha
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Note that \fBhistedit\fP does \fInot\fP remove any revisions (even its own temporary
ones) until after it has completed all the editing operations, so it will
probably perform several strip operations when it\(aqs done. For the above example,
it had to run strip twice. Strip can be slow depending on a variety of factors,
so you might need to be a little patient. You can choose to keep the original
revisions by passing the \fB\-\-keep\fP flag.
.sp
The \fBedit\fP operation will drop you back to a command prompt,
allowing you to edit files freely, or even use \fBhg record\fP to commit
some changes as a separate commit. When you\(aqre done, any remaining
uncommitted changes will be committed as well. When done, run \fBhg
histedit \-\-continue\fP to finish this step. If there are uncommitted
changes, you\(aqll be prompted for a new commit message, but the default
commit message will be the original message for the \fBedit\fP ed
revision, and the date of the original commit will be preserved.
.sp
The \fBmessage\fP operation will give you a chance to revise a commit
message without changing the contents. It\(aqs a shortcut for doing
\fBedit\fP immediately followed by \fIhg histedit \-\-continue\(ga\fP.
.sp
If \fBhistedit\fP encounters a conflict when moving a revision (while
handling \fBpick\fP or \fBfold\fP), it\(aqll stop in a similar manner to
\fBedit\fP with the difference that it won\(aqt prompt you for a commit
message when done. If you decide at this point that you don\(aqt like how
much work it will be to rearrange history, or that you made a mistake,
you can use \fBhg histedit \-\-abort\fP to abandon the new changes you
have made and return to the state before you attempted to edit your
history.

.SS Config
.sp
Histedit rule lines are truncated to 80 characters by default. You
can customize this behavior by setting a different length in your
configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[histedit]
linelen = 120      # truncate rule lines at 120 characters
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The summary of a change can be customized as well:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[histedit]
summary\-template = \(aq{rev} {bookmarks} {desc|firstline}\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The customized summary should be kept short enough that rule lines
will fit in the configured line length. See above if that requires
customization.
.sp
\fBhg histedit\fP attempts to automatically choose an appropriate base
revision to use. To change which base revision is used, define a
revset in your configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[histedit]
defaultrev = only(.) & draft()
.ft P
.fi
.sp
By default each edited revision needs to be present in histedit commands.
To remove revision you need to use \fBdrop\fP operation. You can configure
the drop to be implicit for missing commits by adding:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[histedit]
dropmissing = True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
By default, histedit will close the transaction after each action. For
performance purposes, you can configure histedit to use a single transaction
across the entire histedit. WARNING: This setting introduces a significant risk
of losing the work you\(aqve done in a histedit if the histedit aborts
unexpectedly:

.IP \(bu 2
.
Otherwise, the value from the "histedit.defaultrev" config option
is used as a revset to select the base revision when ANCESTOR is not
specified. The first revision returned by the revset is used. By
default, this selects the editable history that is unique to the
ancestry of the working directory.
.UNINDENT

If you use \-\-outgoing, this command will abort if there are ambiguous
outgoing revisions. For example, if there are multiple branches
containing outgoing revisions.
.sp
Use "min(outgoing() and ::.)" or similar revset specification
instead of \-\-outgoing to specify edit target revision exactly in
such ambiguous situation. See \%\fBhg help revsets\fP\: for detail about
selecting revisions.

This extension provides a number of simple hooks to handle issues
commonly found in repositories with many contributors:
\- email notification when changesets move from draft to public phase
\- email notification when changesets are obsoleted
\- enforcement of draft phase for all incoming changesets
\- enforcement of a no\-branch\-merge policy
\- enforcement of a no\-multiple\-heads policy

The journal is used to see the previous commits that bookmarks and the
working copy pointed to. By default the previous locations for the working

that bookmark. Use the \-\-all switch to show previous locations for all
bookmarks and the working copy; each line will then include the bookmark
name, or \(aq.\(aq for the working copy, as well.

If \fIname\fP starts with \fIre:\fP, the remainder of the name is treated as
a regular expression. To match a name that actually starts with \fIre:\fP,
use the prefix \fIliteral:\fP.
.sp
By default hg journal only shows the commit hash and the command that was
running at that time. \-v/\-\-verbose will show the prior hash, the user, and
the time at which it happened.
.sp
Use \-c/\-\-commits to output log information on each commit hash; at this

.SS keyword
.sp
expand keywords in tracked files
.sp
This extension expands RCS/CVS\-like or self\-customized $Keywords$ in
tracked text files selected by your configuration.
.sp
Keywords are only expanded in local repositories and not stored in the
change history. The mechanism can be regarded as a convenience for the
current user or for archive distribution.
.sp
Keywords expand to the changeset data pertaining to the latest change
relative to the working directory parent of each file.
.sp
Configuration is done in the [keyword], [keywordset] and [keywordmaps]
sections of hgrc files.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[keyword]
# expand keywords in every python file except those matching "x*"
**.py =
x*    = ignore

[keywordset]
# prefer svn\- over cvs\-like default keywordmaps

.SS largefiles
.sp
track large binary files
.sp
Large binary files tend to be not very compressible, not very
diffable, and not at all mergeable. Such files are not handled
efficiently by Mercurial\(aqs storage format (revlog), which is based on
compressed binary deltas; storing large binary files as regular
Mercurial files wastes bandwidth and disk space and increases
Mercurial\(aqs memory usage. The largefiles extension addresses these
problems by adding a centralized client\-server layer on top of
Mercurial: largefiles live in a \fIcentral store\fP out on the network
somewhere, and you only fetch the revisions that you need when you
need them.
.sp
largefiles works by maintaining a "standin file" in .hglf/ for each
largefile. The standins are small (41 bytes: an SHA\-1 hash plus
newline) and are tracked by Mercurial. Largefile revisions are
identified by the SHA\-1 hash of their contents, which is written to
the standin. largefiles uses that revision ID to get/put largefile
revisions from/to the central store. This saves both disk space and
bandwidth, since you don\(aqt need to retrieve all historical revisions
of large files when you clone or pull.
.sp
To start a new repository or add new large binary files, just add
\-\-large to your \%\fBhg add\fP\: command. For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=randomdata count=2000
$ hg add \-\-large randomdata
$ hg commit \-m "add randomdata as a largefile"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
When you push a changeset that adds/modifies largefiles to a remote
repository, its largefile revisions will be uploaded along with it.
Note that the remote Mercurial must also have the largefiles extension
enabled for this to work.
.sp
When you pull a changeset that affects largefiles from a remote
repository, the largefiles for the changeset will by default not be
pulled down. However, when you update to such a revision, any
largefiles needed by that revision are downloaded and cached (if
they have never been downloaded before). One way to pull largefiles
when pulling is thus to use \-\-update, which will update your working
copy to the latest pulled revision (and thereby downloading any new
largefiles).
.sp
If you want to pull largefiles you don\(aqt need for update yet, then
you can use pull with the \fI\-\-lfrev\fP option or the \%\fBhg lfpull\fP\: command.
.sp
If you know you are pulling from a non\-default location and want to
download all the largefiles that correspond to the new changesets at
the same time, then you can pull with \fI\-\-lfrev "pulled()"\fP.
.sp
If you just want to ensure that you will have the largefiles needed to
merge or rebase with new heads that you are pulling, then you can pull
with \fI\-\-lfrev "head(pulled())"\fP flag to pre\-emptively download any largefiles
that are new in the heads you are pulling.
.sp
Keep in mind that network access may now be required to update to
changesets that you have not previously updated to. The nature of the
largefiles extension means that updating is no longer guaranteed to
be a local\-only operation.
.sp
If you already have large files tracked by Mercurial without the
largefiles extension, you will need to convert your repository in
order to benefit from largefiles. This is done with the
\%\fBhg lfconvert\fP\: command:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hg lfconvert \-\-size 10 oldrepo newrepo
.ft P
.fi
.sp
In repositories that already have largefiles in them, any new file
over 10MB will automatically be added as a largefile. To change this
threshold, set \fBlargefiles.minsize\fP in your Mercurial config file
to the minimum size in megabytes to track as a largefile, or use the
\-\-lfsize option to the add command (also in megabytes):
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[largefiles]
minsize = 2

$ hg add \-\-lfsize 2
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The \fBlargefiles.patterns\fP config option allows you to specify a list
of filename patterns (see \%\fBhg help patterns\fP\:) that should always be
tracked as largefiles:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[largefiles]
patterns =
  *.jpg
  re:.*\e.(png|bmp)$
  library.zip
  content/audio/*
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Files that match one of these patterns will be added as largefiles
regardless of their size.
.sp
The \fBlargefiles.minsize\fP and \fBlargefiles.patterns\fP config options
will be ignored for any repositories not already containing a
largefile. To add the first largefile to a repository, you must
explicitly do so with the \-\-large flag passed to the \%\fBhg add\fP\:
command.

lfs \- large file support (EXPERIMENTAL)
.sp
This extension allows large files to be tracked outside of the normal
repository storage and stored on a centralized server, similar to the
\fBlargefiles\fP extension.  The \fBgit\-lfs\fP protocol is used when
communicating with the server, so existing git infrastructure can be
harnessed.  Even though the files are stored outside of the repository,
they are still integrity checked in the same manner as normal files.
.sp
The files stored outside of the repository are downloaded on demand,
which reduces the time to clone, and possibly the local disk usage.
This changes fundamental workflows in a DVCS, so careful thought
should be given before deploying it.  \%\fBhg convert\fP\: can be used to
convert LFS repositories to normal repositories that no longer
require this extension, and do so without changing the commit hashes.
This allows the extension to be disabled if the centralized workflow
becomes burdensome.  However, the pre and post convert clones will
not be able to communicate with each other unless the extension is
enabled on both.
.sp
To start a new repository, or to add LFS files to an existing one, just
create an \fB.hglfs\fP file as described below in the root directory of
the repository.  Typically, this file should be put under version
control, so that the settings will propagate to other repositories with
push and pull.  During any commit, Mercurial will consult this file to
determine if an added or modified file should be stored externally.  The
type of storage depends on the characteristics of the file at each
commit.  A file that is near a size threshold may switch back and forth
between LFS and normal storage, as needed.
.sp
Alternately, both normal repositories and largefile controlled
repositories can be converted to LFS by using \%\fBhg convert\fP\: and the
\fBlfs.track\fP config option described below.  The \fB.hglfs\fP file
should then be created and added, to control subsequent LFS selection.
The hashes are also unchanged in this case.  The LFS and non\-LFS
repositories can be distinguished because the LFS repository will
abort any command if this extension is disabled.
.sp
Committed LFS files are held locally, until the repository is pushed.
Prior to pushing the normal repository data, the LFS files that are
tracked by the outgoing commits are automatically uploaded to the
configured central server.  No LFS files are transferred on
\%\fBhg pull\fP\: or \%\fBhg clone\fP\:.  Instead, the files are downloaded on
demand as they need to be read, if a cached copy cannot be found
locally.  Both committing and downloading an LFS file will link the
file to a usercache, to speed up future access.  See the \fIusercache\fP
config setting described below.
.sp
The extension reads its configuration from a versioned \fB.hglfs\fP
configuration file found in the root of the working directory. The
\fB.hglfs\fP file uses the same syntax as all other Mercurial
configuration files. It uses a single section, \fB[track]\fP.
.sp
The \fB[track]\fP section specifies which files are stored as LFS (or
not). Each line is keyed by a file pattern, with a predicate value.
The first file pattern match is used, so put more specific patterns
first.  The available predicates are \fBall()\fP, \fBnone()\fP, and
\fBsize()\fP. See "hg help filesets.size" for the latter.
.sp
Example versioned \fB.hglfs\fP file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[track]
# No Makefile or python file, anywhere, will be LFS
**Makefile = none()
**.py = none()

**.zip = all()
**.exe = size(">1MB")

# Catchall for everything not matched above
** = size(">10MB")

.SS logtoprocess
.sp
send ui.log() data to a subprocess (EXPERIMENTAL)
.sp
This extension lets you specify a shell command per ui.log() event,
sending all remaining arguments to as environment variables to that command.
.sp
Positional arguments construct a log message, which is passed in the \fIMSG1\fP
environment variables. Each keyword argument is set as a \fIOPT_UPPERCASE_KEY\fP
variable (so the key is uppercased, and prefixed with \fIOPT_\fP). The original
event name is passed in the \fIEVENT\fP environment variable, and the process ID
of mercurial is given in \fIHGPID\fP.
.sp
So given a call \fIui.log(\(aqfoo\(aq, \(aqbar %s
\(aq, \(aqbaz\(aq, spam=\(aqeggs\(aq), a script
configured for the \(gafoo\fP event can expect an environment with \fIMSG1=bar baz\fP,
and \fIOPT_SPAM=eggs\fP.
.sp
Scripts are configured in the \fI[logtoprocess]\fP section, each key an event name.
For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[logtoprocess]
commandexception = echo "$MSG1" > /var/log/mercurial_exceptions.log
.ft P
.fi
.sp
would log the warning message and traceback of any failed command dispatch.
.sp
Scripts are run asynchronously as detached daemon processes; mercurial will
not ensure that they exit cleanly.
.SS mq
.sp
manage a stack of patches
.sp
This extension lets you work with a stack of patches in a Mercurial
repository. It manages two stacks of patches \- all known patches, and
applied patches (subset of known patches).
.sp
Known patches are represented as patch files in the .hg/patches
directory. Applied patches are both patch files and changesets.
.sp
Common tasks (use \%\fBhg help COMMAND\fP\: for more details):
.sp
.nf
.ft C
create new patch                          qnew
import existing patch                     qimport

print patch series                        qseries
print applied patches                     qapplied

add known patch to applied stack          qpush
remove patch from applied stack           qpop
refresh contents of top applied patch     qrefresh
.ft P
.fi
.sp
By default, mq will automatically use git patches when required to
avoid losing file mode changes, copy records, binary files or empty
files creations or deletions. This behavior can be configured with:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[mq]
git = auto/keep/yes/no
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If set to \(aqkeep\(aq, mq will obey the [diff] section configuration while
preserving existing git patches upon qrefresh. If set to \(aqyes\(aq or
\(aqno\(aq, mq will override the [diff] section and always generate git or
regular patches, possibly losing data in the second case.
.sp
It may be desirable for mq changesets to be kept in the secret phase (see
\%\fBhg help phases\fP\:), which can be enabled with the following setting:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[mq]
secret = True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You will by default be managing a patch queue named "patches". You can
create other, independent patch queues with the \%\fBhg qqueue\fP\: command.
.sp
If the working directory contains uncommitted files, qpush, qpop and
qgoto abort immediately. If \-f/\-\-force is used, the changes are
discarded. Setting:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[mq]
keepchanges = True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
make them behave as if \-\-keep\-changes were passed, and non\-conflicting
local changes will be tolerated and preserved. If incompatible options
such as \-f/\-\-force or \-\-exact are passed, this setting is ignored.
.sp
This extension used to provide a strip command. This command now lives
in the strip extension.
.SS Commands
.SS Repository creation
.SS qclone
.sp
clone main and patch repository at same time:
.sp
.nf

If source is local, destination will have no patches applied. If
source is remote, this command can not check if patches are
applied in source, so cannot guarantee that patches are not
applied in destination. If you clone remote repository, be sure
before that it has no patches applied.
.sp
Source patch repository is looked for in <src>/.hg/patches by
default. Use \-p <url> to change.

.sp
Supports switching between different patch queues, as well as creating
new patch queues and deleting existing ones.
.sp
Omitting a queue name or specifying \-l/\-\-list will show you the registered

set or print guarded patches to push:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg qselect [OPTION]... [GUARD]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Use the \%\fBhg qguard\fP\: command to set or print guards on patch, then use
qselect to tell mq which guards to use. A patch will be pushed if
it has no guards or any positive guards match the currently
selected guard, but will not be pushed if any negative guards
match the current guard. For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
qguard foo.patch \-\- \-stable    (negative guard)
qguard bar.patch    +stable    (positive guard)
qselect stable
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This activates the "stable" guard. mq will skip foo.patch (because
it has a negative match) but push bar.patch (because it has a
positive match).
.sp
With no arguments, prints the currently active guards.
With one argument, sets the active guard.
.sp
Use \-n/\-\-none to deactivate guards (no other arguments needed).
When no guards are active, patches with positive guards are
skipped and patches with negative guards are pushed.
.sp
qselect can change the guards on applied patches. It does not pop
guarded patches by default. Use \-\-pop to pop back to the last
applied patch that is not guarded. Use \-\-reapply (which implies
\-\-pop) to push back to the current patch afterwards, but skip
guarded patches.
.sp
Use \-s/\-\-series to print a list of all guards in the series file

.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg qimport [\-e] [\-n NAME] [\-f] [\-g] [\-P] [\-r REV]... [FILE]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The patch is inserted into the series after the last applied
patch. If no patches have been applied, qimport prepends the patch
to the series.
.sp
The patch will have the same name as its source file unless you
give it a new one with \-n/\-\-name.
.sp
You can register an existing patch inside the patch directory with
the \-e/\-\-existing flag.
.sp
With \-f/\-\-force, an existing patch of the same name will be
overwritten.
.sp
An existing changeset may be placed under mq control with \-r/\-\-rev
(e.g. qimport \-\-rev . \-n patch will place the current revision
under mq control). With \-g/\-\-git, patches imported with \-\-rev will
use the git diff format. See the diffs help topic for information
on why this is important for preserving rename/copy information
and permission changes. Use \%\fBhg qfinish\fP\: to remove changesets
from mq control.
.sp
To import a patch from standard input, pass \- as the patch file.
When importing from standard input, a patch name must be specified
using the \-\-name flag.

.ft P
.fi
.sp
With no argument, shows the current narrowspec entries, one per line. Each
line will be prefixed with \(aqI\(aq or \(aqX\(aq for included or excluded patterns,
respectively.
.sp
The narrowspec is comprised of expressions to match remote files and/or
directories that should be pulled into your client.
The narrowspec has \fIinclude\fP and \fIexclude\fP expressions, with excludes always
trumping includes: that is, if a file matches an exclude expression, it will
be excluded even if it also matches an include expression.
Excluding files that were never included has no effect.
.sp
Each included or excluded entry is in the format described by
\(aqhg help patterns\(aq.
.sp
The options allow you to add or remove included and excluded expressions.
.sp
If \-\-clear is specified, then all previous includes and excludes are DROPPED
and replaced by the new ones specified to \-\-addinclude and \-\-addexclude.
If \-\-clear is specified without any further options, the narrowspec will be
empty and will not match any files.
.sp
If \-\-auto\-remove\-includes is specified, then those includes that don\(aqt match
any files modified by currently visible local commits (those not shared by
the remote) will be added to the set of explicitly specified includes to
remove.
.sp

.SS notify
.sp
hooks for sending email push notifications
.sp
This extension implements hooks to send email notifications when
changesets are sent from or received by the local repository.
.sp
First, enable the extension as explained in \%\fBhg help extensions\fP\:, and
register the hook you want to run. \fBincoming\fP and \fBchangegroup\fP hooks
are run when changesets are received, while \fBoutgoing\fP hooks are for
changesets sent to another repository:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[hooks]
# one email for each incoming changeset
incoming.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook
# one email for all incoming changesets
changegroup.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook

# one email for all outgoing changesets
outgoing.notify = python:hgext.notify.hook
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This registers the hooks. To enable notification, subscribers must
be assigned to repositories. The \fB[usersubs]\fP section maps multiple
repositories to a given recipient. The \fB[reposubs]\fP section maps
multiple recipients to a single repository:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[usersubs]
# key is subscriber email, value is a comma\-separated list of repo patterns
user@host = pattern

[reposubs]
# key is repo pattern, value is a comma\-separated list of subscriber emails
pattern = user@host
.ft P
.fi
.sp
A \fBpattern\fP is a \fBglob\fP matching the absolute path to a repository,
optionally combined with a revset expression. A revset expression, if
present, is separated from the glob by a hash. Example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[reposubs]
*/widgets#branch(release) = qa\-team@example.com
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This sends to \fBqa\-team@example.com\fP whenever a changeset on the \fBrelease\fP
branch triggers a notification in any repository ending in \fBwidgets\fP.
.sp
In order to place them under direct user management, \fB[usersubs]\fP and
\fB[reposubs]\fP sections may be placed in a separate \fBhgrc\fP file and
incorporated by reference:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[notify]
config = /path/to/subscriptionsfile
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Notifications will not be sent until the \fBnotify.test\fP value is set
to \fBFalse\fP; see below.
.sp
Notifications content can be tweaked with the following configuration entries:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B notify.test
.
If \fBTrue\fP, print messages to stdout instead of sending them. Default: True.
.TP
.B notify.sources
.
Space\-separated list of change sources. Notifications are activated only
when a changeset\(aqs source is in this list. Sources may be:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBserve\fP

.TP
.B notify.strip
.
Number of leading slashes to strip from url paths. By default, notifications
reference repositories with their absolute path. \fBnotify.strip\fP lets you
turn them into relative paths. For example, \fBnotify.strip=3\fP will change
\fB/long/path/repository\fP into \fBrepository\fP. Default: 0.
.TP
.B notify.domain
.
Default email domain for sender or recipients with no explicit domain.
It is also used for the domain part of the \fBMessage\-Id\fP when using
\fBnotify.messageidseed\fP.
.TP
.B notify.messageidseed
.
Create deterministic \fBMessage\-Id\fP headers for the mails based on the seed
and the revision identifier of the first commit in the changeset.
.TP
.B notify.style
.

\fBnotify.template\fP.
.TP
.B notify.maxdiff
.
Maximum number of diff lines to include in notification email. Set to 0
to disable the diff, or \-1 to include all of it. Default: 300.
.TP
.B notify.maxdiffstat
.
Maximum number of diffstat lines to include in notification email. Set to \-1

.TP
.B notify.maxsubject

Set to True to include a diffstat before diff content. Default: True.
.TP
.B notify.showfunc
.
If set, override \fBdiff.showfunc\fP for the diff content. Default: None.
.TP
.B notify.merge
.
If True, send notifications for merge changesets. Default: True.
.TP
.B notify.mbox
.
If set, append mails to this mbox file instead of sending. Default: None.
.TP
.B notify.fromauthor
.
If set, use the committer of the first changeset in a changegroup for
the "From" field of the notification mail. If not set, take the user
from the pushing repo.  Default: False.
.TP
.B notify.reply\-to\-predecessor (EXPERIMENTAL)
.
If set and the changeset has a predecessor in the repository, try to thread
the notification mail with the predecessor. This adds the "In\-Reply\-To" header
to the notification mail with a reference to the predecessor with the smallest
revision number. Mail threads can still be torn, especially when changesets
are folded.
.sp
This option must  be used in combination with \fBnotify.messageidseed\fP.
.UNINDENT

.SS patchbomb
.sp
command to send changesets as (a series of) patch emails
.sp
The series is started off with a "[PATCH 0 of N]" introduction, which
describes the series as a whole.
.sp
Each patch email has a Subject line of "[PATCH M of N] ...", using the
first line of the changeset description as the subject text. The
message contains two or three body parts:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
The changeset description.
.IP \(bu 2
.
[Optional] The result of running diffstat on the patch.
.IP \(bu 2
.
The patch itself, as generated by \%\fBhg export\fP\:.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Each message refers to the first in the series using the In\-Reply\-To
and References headers, so they will show up as a sequence in threaded
mail and news readers, and in mail archives.
.sp
To configure other defaults, add a section like this to your
configuration file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[email]
from = My Name <my@email>
to = recipient1, recipient2, ...
cc = cc1, cc2, ...
bcc = bcc1, bcc2, ...
reply\-to = address1, address2, ...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Use \fB[patchbomb]\fP as configuration section name if you need to
override global \fB[email]\fP address settings.
.sp
Then you can use the \%\fBhg email\fP\: command to mail a series of
changesets as a patchbomb.
.sp
You can also either configure the method option in the email section
to be a sendmail compatible mailer or fill out the [smtp] section so
that the patchbomb extension can automatically send patchbombs
directly from the commandline. See the [email] and [smtp] sections in
hgrc(5) for details.
.sp
By default, \%\fBhg email\fP\: will prompt for a \fBTo\fP or \fBCC\fP header if
you do not supply one via configuration or the command line.  You can
override this to never prompt by configuring an empty value:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[email]
cc =
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can control the default inclusion of an introduction message with the
\fBpatchbomb.intro\fP configuration option. The configuration is always
overwritten by command line flags like \-\-intro and \-\-desc:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[patchbomb]
intro=auto   # include introduction message if more than 1 patch (default)
intro=never  # never include an introduction message
intro=always # always include an introduction message
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can specify a template for flags to be added in subject prefixes. Flags
specified by \-\-flag option are exported as \fB{flags}\fP keyword:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[patchbomb]
flagtemplate = "{separate(\(aq \(aq,
                          ifeq(branch, \(aqdefault\(aq, \(aq\(aq, branch|upper),
                          flags)}"
.ft P

.sp
You can set patchbomb to always ask for confirmation by setting
\fBpatchbomb.confirm\fP to true.

By default, diffs are sent in the format generated by
\%\fBhg export\fP\:, one per message. The series starts with a "[PATCH 0
of N]" introduction, which describes the series as a whole.
.sp
Each patch email has a Subject line of "[PATCH M of N] ...", using
the first line of the changeset description as the subject text.
The message contains two or three parts. First, the changeset
description.
.sp
With the \-d/\-\-diffstat option, if the diffstat program is
installed, the result of running diffstat on the patch is inserted.
.sp
Finally, the patch itself, as generated by \%\fBhg export\fP\:.
.sp
With the \-d/\-\-diffstat or \-\-confirm options, you will be presented
with a final summary of all messages and asked for confirmation before
the messages are sent.
.sp
By default the patch is included as text in the email body for
easy reviewing. Using the \-a/\-\-attach option will instead create
an attachment for the patch. With \-i/\-\-inline an inline attachment
will be created. You can include a patch both as text in the email
body and as a regular or an inline attachment by combining the
\-a/\-\-attach or \-i/\-\-inline with the \-\-body option.
.sp
With \-B/\-\-bookmark changesets reachable by the given bookmark are
selected.
.sp
With \-o/\-\-outgoing, emails will be generated for patches not found
in the destination repository (or only those which are ancestors
of the specified revisions if any are provided)
.sp
With \-b/\-\-bundle, changesets are selected as for \-\-outgoing, but a
single email containing a binary Mercurial bundle as an attachment
will be sent. Use the \fBpatchbomb.bundletype\fP config option to
control the bundle type as with \%\fBhg bundle \-\-type\fP\:.

With \-m/\-\-mbox, instead of previewing each patchbomb message in a
pager or sending the messages directly, it will create a UNIX
mailbox file with the patch emails. This mailbox file can be
previewed with any mail user agent which supports UNIX mbox
files.
.sp
With \-n/\-\-test, all steps will run, but mail will not be sent.
You will be prompted for an email recipient address, a subject and
an introductory message describing the patches of your patchbomb.
Then when all is done, patchbomb messages are displayed.

In case email sending fails, you will find a backup of your series
introductory message in \fB.hg/last\-email.txt\fP.

This extension provides a \fBphabsend\fP command which sends a stack of
changesets to Phabricator, and a \fBphabread\fP command which prints a stack of
revisions in a format suitable for \%\fBhg import\fP\:, and a \fBphabupdate\fP command
to update statuses in batch.
.sp
A "phabstatus" view for \%\fBhg show\fP\: is also provided; it displays status
information of Phabricator differentials associated with unfinished

.sp
By default, Phabricator requires \fBTest Plan\fP which might prevent some
changeset from being sent. The requirement could be disabled by changing
\fBdifferential.require\-test\-plan\-field\fP config server side.

DREVSPEC could be a Differential Revision identity, like \fBD123\fP, or just
the number \fB123\fP. It could also have common operators like \fB+\fP, \fB\-\fP,
\fB&\fP, \fB(\fP, \fB)\fP for complex queries. Prefix \fB:\fP could be used to
select a stack.  If multiple DREVSPEC values are given, the result is the
union of each individually evaluated value.  No attempt is currently made
to reorder the values to run from parent to child.
.sp
\fBabandoned\fP, \fBaccepted\fP, \fBclosed\fP, \fBneedsreview\fP, \fBneedsrevision\fP
could be used to filter patches by status. For performance reason, they
only represent a subset of non\-status selections and cannot be used alone.
.sp
For example, \fB:D6+8\-(2+D4)\fP selects a stack up to D6, plus D8 and exclude
D2 and D4. \fB:D9 & needsreview\fP selects "Needs Review" revisions in a
stack up to D9.
.sp
If \-\-stack is given, follow dependencies information and read all patches.

.sp
If there are multiple revisions specified, they will be send as a stack
with a linear dependencies relationship using the order specified by the
revset.
.sp
For the first time uploading changesets, local tags will be created to
maintain the association. After the first time, phabsend will check
obsstore and tags information so it can figure out whether to update an
existing Differential Revision, or create a new one.
.sp
If \-\-amend is set, update commit messages so they have the
\fBDifferential Revision\fP URL, remove related tags. This is similar to what
arcanist will do, and is more desired in author\-push workflows. Otherwise,
use local tags to record the \fBDifferential Revision\fP association.
.sp
The \-\-confirm option lets you confirm changesets before sending them. You
can also add following to your configuration file to make it default
behaviour:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[phabsend]

.sp
By default, a separate review will be created for each commit that is
selected, and will have the same parent/child relationship in Phabricator.
If \fB\-\-fold\fP is set, multiple commits are rolled up into a single review
as if diffed from the parent of the first revision to the last.  The commit
messages are concatenated in the summary field on Phabricator.

.SS rebase
.sp
command to move sets of revisions to a different ancestor
.sp
This extension lets you rebase changesets in an existing Mercurial
repository.
.sp
For more information:
\%https://mercurial\-scm.org/wiki/RebaseExtension\:
.SS Commands
.SS Change manipulation
.SS rebase
.sp
move changeset (and descendants) to a different branch:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg rebase [[\-s REV]... | [\-b REV]... | [\-r REV]...] [\-d REV] [OPTION]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Rebase uses repeated merging to graft changesets from one part of
history (the source) onto another (the destination). This can be
useful for linearizing \fIlocal\fP changes relative to a master
development tree.
.sp
Published commits cannot be rebased (see \%\fBhg help phases\fP\:).
To copy commits, see \%\fBhg help graft\fP\:.
.sp
If you don\(aqt specify a destination changeset (\fB\-d/\-\-dest\fP), rebase
will use the same logic as \%\fBhg merge\fP\: to pick a destination.  if
the current branch contains exactly one other head, the other head
is merged with by default.  Otherwise, an explicit revision with
which to merge with must be provided.  (destination changeset is not
modified by rebasing, but new changesets are added as its
descendants.)
.sp
Here are the ways to select changesets:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
.
Explicitly select them using \fB\-\-rev\fP.
.IP 2. 3
.
Use \fB\-\-source\fP to select a root changeset and include all of its
descendants.
.IP 3. 3
.
Use \fB\-\-base\fP to select a changeset; rebase will find ancestors
and their descendants which are not also ancestors of the destination.
.IP 4. 3
.
If you do not specify any of \fB\-\-rev\fP, \fB\-\-source\fP, or \fB\-\-base\fP,
rebase will use \fB\-\-base .\fP as above.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If \fB\-\-source\fP or \fB\-\-rev\fP is used, special names \fBSRC\fP and \fBALLSRC\fP
can be used in \fB\-\-dest\fP. Destination would be calculated per source
revision with \fBSRC\fP substituted by that single source revision and
\fBALLSRC\fP substituted by all source revisions.
.sp
Rebase will destroy original changesets unless you use \fB\-\-keep\fP.
It will also move your bookmarks (even if you do).
.sp
Some changesets may be dropped if they do not contribute changes
(e.g. merges from the destination branch).
.sp
Unlike \fBmerge\fP, rebase will do nothing if you are at the branch tip of
a named branch with two heads. You will need to explicitly specify source
and/or destination.
.sp
If you need to use a tool to automate merge/conflict decisions, you
can specify one with \fB\-\-tool\fP, see \%\fBhg help merge\-tools\fP\:.
As a caveat: the tool will not be used to mediate when a file was
deleted, there is no hook presently available for this.
.sp
If a rebase is interrupted to manually resolve a conflict, it can be
continued with \-\-continue/\-c, aborted with \-\-abort/\-a, or stopped with
\-\-stop.
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
move "local changes" (current commit back to branching point)
to the current branch tip after a pull:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg rebase

.IP \(bu 2
.
move a single changeset to the stable branch:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg rebase \-r 5f493448 \-d stable
.ft P
.fi
.IP \(bu 2
.
splice a commit and all its descendants onto another part of history:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg rebase \-\-source c0c3 \-\-dest 4cf9
.ft P

.IP \(bu 2

.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg rebase \-\-base myfeature \-\-dest default

move a named branch while preserving its name:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg rebase \-r "branch(featureX)" \-d 1.3 \-\-keepbranches
.ft P

.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.sp
Configuration Options:
.sp
You can make rebase require a destination if you set the following config
option:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[commands]
rebase.requiredest = True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
By default, rebase will close the transaction after each commit. For
performance purposes, you can configure rebase to use a single transaction
across the entire rebase. WARNING: This setting introduces a significant
risk of losing the work you\(aqve done in a rebase if the rebase aborts
unexpectedly:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[rebase]
singletransaction = True
.ft P
.fi
.sp
By default, rebase writes to the working copy, but you can configure it to
run in\-memory for better performance. When the rebase is not moving the
parent(s) of the working copy (AKA the "currently checked out changesets"),
this may also allow it to run even if the working copy is dirty:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[rebase]

.SS releasenotes
.sp
generate release notes from commit messages (EXPERIMENTAL)

It is common to maintain files detailing changes in a project between

The \%\fBhg releasenotes\fP\: command provided by this extension makes the
process simpler by automating it.
.SS Commands
.SS Change navigation
.SS releasenotes
.sp
parse release notes from commit messages into an output file:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg releasenotes [\-r REV] [\-c] FILE

.fi
.sp
Given an output file and set of revisions, this command will parse commit
messages for release notes then add them to the output file.
.sp
Release notes are defined in commit messages as ReStructuredText
directives. These have the form:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\&.. directive:: title

   content
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Each \fBdirective\fP maps to an output section in a generated release notes
file, which itself is ReStructuredText. For example, the \fB.. feature::\fP
directive would map to a \fBNew Features\fP section.
.sp
Release note directives can be either short\-form or long\-form. In short\-
form, \fBtitle\fP is omitted and the release note is rendered as a bullet
list. In long form, a sub\-section with the title \fBtitle\fP is added to the
section.
.sp
The \fBFILE\fP argument controls the output file to write gathered release
notes to. The format of the file is:

.SS Commands
.SS Repository maintenance
.SS relink
.sp
recreate hardlinks between two repositories:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg relink [ORIGIN]
.ft P
.fi
.sp
When repositories are cloned locally, their data files will be
hardlinked so that they only use the space of a single repository.
.sp
Unfortunately, subsequent pulls into either repository will break
hardlinks for any files touched by the new changesets, even if
both repositories end up pulling the same changes.
.sp
Similarly, passing \-\-rev to "hg clone" will fail to use any
hardlinks, falling back to a complete copy of the source
repository.
.sp
This command lets you recreate those hardlinks and reclaim that
wasted space.
.sp
This repository will be relinked to share space with ORIGIN, which
must be on the same local disk. If ORIGIN is omitted, looks for
"default\-relink", then "default", in [paths].
.sp
Do not attempt any read operations on this repository while the
command is running. (Both repositories will be locked against
writes.)
.SS remotefilelog

.sp
remotefilelog works by fetching file contents lazily and storing them
in a cache on the client rather than in revlogs. This allows enormous

.SS schemes
.sp
extend schemes with shortcuts to repository swarms
.sp
This extension allows you to specify shortcuts for parent URLs with a
lot of repositories to act like a scheme, for example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[schemes]
py = http://code.python.org/hg/
.ft P
.fi
.sp
After that you can use it like:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg clone py://trunk/
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Additionally there is support for some more complex schemas, for
example used by Google Code:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[schemes]
gcode = http://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/
.ft P
.fi
.sp
The syntax is taken from Mercurial templates, and you have unlimited
number of variables, starting with \fB{1}\fP and continuing with
\fB{2}\fP, \fB{3}\fP and so on. This variables will receive parts of URL
supplied, split by \fB/\fP. Anything not specified as \fB{part}\fP will be
just appended to an URL.
.sp
For convenience, the extension adds these schemes by default:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[schemes]
py = http://hg.python.org/
bb = https://bitbucket.org/
bb+ssh = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/
gcode = https://{1}.googlecode.com/hg/
kiln = https://{1}.kilnhg.com/Repo/
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can override a predefined scheme by defining a new scheme with the
same name.
.SS Commands
.SS Uncategorized commands
.SS share
.sp
share a common history between several working directories
.sp
The share extension introduces a new command \%\fBhg share\fP\: to create a new
working directory. This is similar to \%\fBhg clone\fP\:, but doesn\(aqt involve
copying or linking the storage of the repository. This allows working on
different branches or changes in parallel without the associated cost in
terms of disk space.
.sp
Note: destructive operations or extensions like \%\fBhg rollback\fP\: should be
used with care as they can result in confusing problems.
.SS Automatic Pooled Storage for Clones
.sp
When this extension is active, \%\fBhg clone\fP\: can be configured to
automatically share/pool storage across multiple clones. This
mode effectively converts \%\fBhg clone\fP\: to \%\fBhg clone\fP\: + \%\fBhg share\fP\:.
The benefit of using this mode is the automatic management of
store paths and intelligent pooling of related repositories.
.sp
The following \fBshare.\fP config options influence this feature:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBshare.pool\fP
.sp
Filesystem path where shared repository data will be stored. When
defined, \%\fBhg clone\fP\: will automatically use shared repository
storage instead of creating a store inside each clone.
.TP
.B \fBshare.poolnaming\fP
.sp
How directory names in \fBshare.pool\fP are constructed.
.sp
"identity" means the name is derived from the first changeset in the
repository. In this mode, different remotes share storage if their
root/initial changeset is identical. In this mode, the local shared
repository is an aggregate of all encountered remote repositories.
.sp
"remote" means the name is derived from the source repository\(aqs
path or URL. In this mode, storage is only shared if the path or URL
requested in the \%\fBhg clone\fP\: command matches exactly to a repository
that was cloned before.
.sp
The default naming mode is "identity".
.UNINDENT
.sp
Sharing requirements and configs of source repository with shares:
.sp
By default creating a shared repository only enables sharing a common
history and does not share requirements and configs between them. This
may lead to problems in some cases, for example when you upgrade the
storage format from one repository but does not set related configs
in the shares.
.sp
Setting \fIformat.exp\-share\-safe = True\fP enables sharing configs and
requirements. This only applies to shares which are done after enabling
the config option.
.sp
For enabling this in existing shares, enable the config option and reshare.
.sp
For resharing existing shares, make sure your working directory is clean
and there are no untracked files, delete that share and create a new share.
.SS Commands
.SS Repository creation
.SS share
.sp
create a new shared repository:

.sp
Initialize a new repository and working directory that shares its
history (and optionally bookmarks) with another repository.
.IP Note
.
using rollback or extensions that destroy/modify history (mq,
rebase, etc.) can cause considerable confusion with shared
clones. In particular, if two shared clones are both updated to
the same changeset, and one of them destroys that changeset
with rollback, the other clone will suddenly stop working: all
operations will fail with "abort: working directory has unknown
parent". The only known workaround is to use debugsetparents on
the broken clone to reset it to a changeset that still exists.

.SS sparse
.sp
allow sparse checkouts of the working directory (EXPERIMENTAL)
.sp
(This extension is not yet protected by backwards compatibility
guarantees. Any aspect may break in future releases until this
notice is removed.)
.sp
This extension allows the working directory to only consist of a
subset of files for the revision. This allows specific files or
directories to be explicitly included or excluded. Many repository
operations have performance proportional to the number of files in
the working directory. So only realizing a subset of files in the
working directory can improve performance.
.SS Sparse Config Files
.sp
The set of files that are part of a sparse checkout are defined by
a sparse config file. The file defines 3 things: includes (files to
include in the sparse checkout), excludes (files to exclude from the
sparse checkout), and profiles (links to other config files).
.sp
The file format is newline delimited. Empty lines and lines beginning
with \fB#\fP are ignored.
.sp
Lines beginning with \fB%include \(ga\(ga denote another sparse config file
to include. e.g. \(ga\(ga%include tests.sparse\fP. The filename is relative
to the repository root.
.sp
The special lines \fB[include]\fP and \fB[exclude]\fP denote the section
for includes and excludes that follow, respectively. It is illegal to
have \fB[include]\fP after \fB[exclude]\fP.
.sp
Non\-special lines resemble file patterns to be added to either includes
or excludes. The syntax of these lines is documented by \%\fBhg help patterns\fP\:.
Patterns are interpreted as \fBglob:\fP by default and match against the
root of the repository.
.sp
Exclusion patterns take precedence over inclusion patterns. So even
if a file is explicitly included, an \fB[exclude]\fP entry can remove it.
.sp
For example, say you have a repository with 3 directories, \fBfrontend/\fP,
\fBbackend/\fP, and \fBtools/\fP. \fBfrontend/\fP and \fBbackend/\fP correspond
to different projects and it is uncommon for someone working on one
to need the files for the other. But \fBtools/\fP contains files shared
between both projects. Your sparse config files may resemble:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# frontend.sparse
frontend/**
tools/**

# backend.sparse
backend/**
tools/**
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Say the backend grows in size. Or there\(aqs a directory with thousands
of files you wish to exclude. You can modify the profile to exclude
certain files:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[include]
backend/**
tools/**

[exclude]

The sqlitestore extension enables the storage of repository data in SQLite.
.sp
This extension is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL. There are NO BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
GUARANTEES. This means that repositories created with this extension may
only be usable with the exact version of this extension/Mercurial that was

.SS transplant
.sp
command to transplant changesets from another branch
.sp
This extension allows you to transplant changes to another parent revision,
possibly in another repository. The transplant is done using \(aqdiff\(aq patches.
.sp
Transplanted patches are recorded in .hg/transplant/transplants, as a
map from a changeset hash to its hash in the source repository.
.SS Commands
.SS Change manipulation
.SS transplant
.sp
transplant changesets from another branch:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg transplant [\-s REPO] [\-b BRANCH [\-a]] [\-p REV] [\-m REV] [REV]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Selected changesets will be applied on top of the current working
directory with the log of the original changeset. The changesets
are copied and will thus appear twice in the history with different
identities.
.sp
Consider using the graft command if everything is inside the same
repository \- it will use merges and will usually give a better result.
Use the rebase extension if the changesets are unpublished and you want
to move them instead of copying them.
.sp
If \-\-log is specified, log messages will have a comment appended
of the form:
.sp
.nf
.ft C

.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can rewrite the changelog message with the \-\-filter option.
Its argument will be invoked with the current changelog message as
$1 and the patch as $2.
.sp
\-\-source/\-s specifies another repository to use for selecting changesets,
just as if it temporarily had been pulled.
If \-\-branch/\-b is specified, these revisions will be used as
heads when deciding which changesets to transplant, just as if only
these revisions had been pulled.
If \-\-all/\-a is specified, all the revisions up to the heads specified
with \-\-branch will be transplanted.
.sp
Example:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2

transplant all changes up to REV on top of your current revision:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg transplant \-\-branch REV \-\-all
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.sp
You can optionally mark selected transplanted changesets as merge
changesets. You will not be prompted to transplant any ancestors
of a merged transplant, and you can merge descendants of them
normally instead of transplanting them.
.sp
Merge changesets may be transplanted directly by specifying the
proper parent changeset by calling \%\fBhg transplant \-\-parent\fP\:.
.sp
If no merges or revisions are provided, \%\fBhg transplant\fP\: will
start an interactive changeset browser.
.sp
If a changeset application fails, you can fix the merge by hand
and then resume where you left off by calling \%\fBhg transplant

.SS uncommit
.sp
uncommit part or all of a local changeset (EXPERIMENTAL)
.sp
This command undoes the effect of a local commit, returning the affected
files to their uncommitted state. This means that files modified, added or
removed in the changeset will be left unchanged, and so will remain modified,
added and removed in the working directory.
.SS Commands
.SS Change manipulation
.SS unamend
.sp
undo the most recent amend operation on a current changeset:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg unamend
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This command will roll back to the previous version of a changeset,
leaving working directory in state in which it was before running
\fIhg amend\fP (e.g. files modified as part of an amend will be
marked as modified \fIhg status\fP)
.SS uncommit
.sp
uncommit part or all of a local changeset:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
hg uncommit [OPTION]... [FILE]...
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This command undoes the effect of a local commit, returning the affected
files to their uncommitted state. This means that files modified or
deleted in the changeset will be left unchanged, and so will remain
modified in the working directory.
.sp
If no files are specified, the commit will be pruned, unless \-\-keep is
given.

.UNINDENT
.sp
[+] marked option can be specified multiple times
.SS win32mbcs
.sp
allow the use of MBCS paths with problematic encodings
.sp
Some MBCS encodings are not good for some path operations (i.e.
splitting path, case conversion, etc.) with its encoded bytes. We call
such a encoding (i.e. shift_jis and big5) as "problematic encoding".
This extension can be used to fix the issue with those encodings by
wrapping some functions to convert to Unicode string before path
operation.
.sp
This extension is useful for:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
Japanese Windows users using shift_jis encoding.
.IP \(bu 2
.
Chinese Windows users using big5 encoding.
.IP \(bu 2
.
All users who use a repository with one of problematic encodings on
case\-insensitive file system.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This extension is not needed for:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
Any user who use only ASCII chars in path.
.IP \(bu 2
.
Any user who do not use any of problematic encodings.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that there are some limitations on using this extension:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
.
You should use single encoding in one repository.
.IP \(bu 2
.
If the repository path ends with 0x5c, .hg/hgrc cannot be read.
.IP \(bu 2
.
win32mbcs is not compatible with fixutf8 extension.
.UNINDENT
.sp
By default, win32mbcs uses encoding.encoding decided by Mercurial.
You can specify the encoding by config option:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[win32mbcs]
encoding = sjis
.ft P
.fi
.sp
It is useful for the users who want to commit with UTF\-8 log message.
.SS win32text
.sp
perform automatic newline conversion (DEPRECATED)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
Deprecation: The win32text extension requires each user to configure
the extension again and again for each clone since the configuration
is not copied when cloning.
.sp
We have therefore made the \fBeol\fP as an alternative. The \fBeol\fP
uses a version controlled file for its configuration and each clone
will therefore use the right settings from the start.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To perform automatic newline conversion, use:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[extensions]
win32text =
[encode]
** = cleverencode:
# or ** = macencode:

[decode]
** = cleverdecode:
# or ** = macdecode:
.ft P
.fi
.sp
If not doing conversion, to make sure you do not commit CRLF/CR by accident:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[hooks]
pretxncommit.crlf = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcrlf
# or pretxncommit.cr = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcr
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To do the same check on a server to prevent CRLF/CR from being
pushed or pulled:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
[hooks]
pretxnchangegroup.crlf = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcrlf
# or pretxnchangegroup.cr = python:hgext.win32text.forbidcr
.ft P
.fi
.SS zeroconf
.sp
discover and advertise repositories on the local network
.sp
The zeroconf extension will advertise \%\fBhg serve\fP\: instances over
DNS\-SD so that they can be discovered using the \%\fBhg paths\fP\: command
without knowing the server\(aqs IP address.
.sp
To allow other people to discover your repository using run
\%\fBhg serve\fP\: in your repository:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ cd test
$ hg serve
.ft P
.fi
.sp
You can discover Zeroconf\-enabled repositories by running
\%\fBhg paths\fP\::
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ hg paths
zc\-test = http://example.com:8000/test
.ft P
.fi
.SH FILES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB/etc/mercurial/hgrc\fP, \fB$HOME/.hgrc\fP, \fB.hg/hgrc\fP
.sp
This file contains defaults and configuration. Values in
\fB.hg/hgrc\fP override those in \fB$HOME/.hgrc\fP, and these override
settings made in the global \fB/etc/mercurial/hgrc\fP configuration.
See \%\fBhgrc\fP(5)\: for details of the contents and format of these
files.
.TP
.B \fB.hgignore\fP
.sp
This file contains regular expressions (one per line) that
describe file names that should be ignored by \fBhg\fP. For details,
see \%\fBhgignore\fP(5)\:.
.TP
.B \fB.hgsub\fP
.sp
This file defines the locations of all subrepositories, and
tells where the subrepository checkouts came from. For details, see
\%\fBhg help subrepos\fP\:.
.TP
.B \fB.hgsubstate\fP
.sp
This file is where Mercurial stores all nested repository states. \fINB: This
file should not be edited manually.\fP
.TP
.B \fB.hgtags\fP
.sp
This file contains changeset hash values and text tag names (one
of each separated by spaces) that correspond to tagged versions of
the repository contents. The file content is encoded using UTF\-8.
.TP
.B \fB.hg/last\-message.txt\fP
.sp
This file is used by \%\fBhg commit\fP\: to store a backup of the commit message
in case the commit fails.
.TP
.B \fB.hg/localtags\fP
.sp
This file can be used to define local tags which are not shared among
repositories. The file format is the same as for \fB.hgtags\fP, but it is
encoded using the local system encoding.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Some commands (e.g. revert) produce backup files ending in \fB.orig\fP,
if the \fB.orig\fP file already exists and is not tracked by Mercurial,
it will be overwritten.
.SH BUGS
.sp
Probably lots, please post them to the mailing list (see \%Resources\:
below) when you find them.
